SLP: CS 4970 and CS 4971: Service Learning Practicum (SLP)
==========================================================

[Go up to the main SLP documents page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

This syllabus applies two two courses: CS 4970 in the fall of 2014 (called "Capstone Practicum I") and CS 4971 in the spring of 2015 (called "Capstone Practicum II").

### Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, [https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp/](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp/) ###
### M/W/F 10:00-10:50, Rice 130 for the fall 2014 semester; spring semester TBA ###

**Course Description:** The Service Learning Practicum course involves the application of software engineering and computing principles to the development of a complete software system for non-profit organizations in our community. Students will be working through the entire software system development process, including customer interfacing for requirements, detailed design, and a comprehensive maintenance plan.

**Pre-requisites:** CS 4970 requires CS 2150 with a grade of C- or above.  Ideally you have taken (or are taking) 3240 (Advanced Software Development) or CS 4240 (Object Oriented Design), but those are not required.  Instructor permission is required to enroll in the course, however.  CS 4971 requires CS 4970 as a pre-requisite.

**Course objectives:** Students who complete the course sequence will:

- have gained experience with the development of large software projects through all phases from inception through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- be able to design a customized development methodology for a particular project with given specifications
- understand customer interaction for a software development project
- understand proper documentation generation for a software development project
- be able to properly generate, use, and understand the importance of various artifacts: use cases, requirements documents, etc.

**Meetings:** This course is a practicum, and not a primarily lecture-based course.  Thus, the course meetings will be quite different.  On a typical week, there will be a group meeting day Monday, a lecture on Wednesday, and no class on Friday.  Note that there will be some weeks where we will have classes on Wednesdays and/or Fridays, such as the first two weeks of the fall semester.  In addition, once groups are assigned (late September), each group will have to meet with the customer once every 2 weeks for about 1 hour, and will have a SEPARATE meeting with the course instructor once every 2 weeks (for about 30 minutes).

**Participation:** Participation is vital to this course.  You must participate in the lecture (i.e., by attending) and in your project and group meetings.  Furthermore, you will be required to fill out occassional surveys (3-4 a semester) and complete your time tracking.

**Grades:** See the first slide set for details.  This course is not being graded on a bell curve, which means that everybody could receive an A.  Likewise, everybody could receive a D.

**Special Circumstances:** Students with special circumstances (athletics, extra time required on exams, LNEC considerations, etc.) need to let me know during the **first week of class**.

**Miscellaneous:** There are a few miscellaneous topics:

- There are no required textbooks for this course.
- There are no planned exams for this course.  I reserve the write to add one if I feel like I want to spend some time grading...
- Students will be required to get a github.com account.  Furthermore, students will need 1 or 2 **private** repositories (under their github username).  All students are given a number of free private repositories by github; if you have used all of yours, then you will have to purchase more.  These private repositories will only be needed in the first half of the fall semester, and may be deleted once the assignments that use them have been graded.
- Time tracking: each student must keep very careful track of the number of hours s/he works on the project.  This must be totaled by week.  This is not expect to take very long to do (say, 5 minutes each week), but must be done carefully from the beginning of the course.  More info on this during the first lecture.
- There will be a Collab workspace for this course, although it will not be used much.  Primarily it will be used to provide a download location for various files, and as a means to distribute account credentials.
- Much of the course administration will be handled through a custom website at http://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp.  Project leads will be required to submit their reports through this system, and this will be the how grades are returned.

**Honor Policy:** Standard UVa honor policy.  For this course, that means using other code without appropriate attribution.
