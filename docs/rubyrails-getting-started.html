<h2 id="install-ruby-and-rails">Install Ruby and Rails</h2>
<p>Note that Ruby is the programming language, and Rails is the framework. When all is completed, you <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> have Ruby version 2.1.2 installed and Rails 4.1.5 installed. It's okay if you have a different patch level version (i.e., Ruby 2.1.3 or rails 4.1.6, for example), but you can't have a different minor or major version.</p>
<p>If you are running this on the VirtualBox image, then this step has already been performed.</p>
<p>If you are running this on your <em>own</em> machine, then you will want to follow the instructions at https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04 if you are running Ubuntu 14.04. If you are running Mac OS X, that site has directions <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/osx">here</a>. Likewise, other versions of Ubuntu can be found from those two links. If you are using another operating system, you are on your own (but note that the versions <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> match what we are using (Ruby 2.1.2 and Rails 4.1.5)).</p>
<p>To install this on the course server, you could follow the directions from https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04. However, those directions create a series of directories, which have already been partially done for you. Instead, follow these steps. Note that this will only work on the course server!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Enter <code>cd</code> to ensure you are in your home directory</li>
<li>Enter <code>tar xfz /usr/local/rails-setup.tgz</code></li>
<li>Edit your <code>.bashrc</code> file, and add the three lines indicated in the <code>bashrc-mods.txt</code> file</li>
<li>Log out, then log back in again</li>
<li>Try the &quot;final steps&quot; commands from <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">those directions</a>. In particular, if you run <code>rails new myapp</code>, then it should work.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have to run through the rest of the &quot;final steps&quot; commands to configure your rails application. As your first rails application needs to be called &quot;rubyrails&quot;, you will need to enter <code>rails new rubyrails -d mysql</code>, and then the rest of the commands listed there.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-your-rails-application-locally">Viewing your Rails application locally</h2>
<p>If you want to view your rails application locally, you can view it via the rails server, as described in <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">those directions</a>. This will allow you to view it at <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your favorite web browser.</p>
