<h1 id="slp-ruby-on-rails-deployment">SLP: Ruby on Rails: Deployment</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main SLP documents page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>This page is for how to <em>deploy</em> your Ruby on Rails apps on an Ubuntu server -- specifically, Ubuntu 14.04. This is not needed for your local development, as you can run <code>rails server</code> to test it out locally, or test it out on the course server provided. However, if you <strong><em>do</em></strong> want to get it running through Apache, read on...</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails is run through Apache via a module called Phusion Passenger (or just &quot;Passenger&quot;). It is that module that must be installed and configured.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> By following the directions on the <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page, the paths and ruby versions are set to custom values within the user's directory. The instructions here were NOT run by that user, and I don't know what would happen if they were.</p>
<h2 id="installing-passenger">Installing Passenger</h2>
<p>First, we need to install Passenger. Following the directions <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html">here</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#install_on_debian_ubuntu">section 2.3</a>, I ran the following commands:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates</code></pre>
It may well be the case that the second of those two commands does not install any new packages.</li>
<li><p>Edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list (a new file), and add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>deb https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger trusty main</code></pre>
If you are using a version of Ubuntu that is <em>not</em> 14.04, see the above URL for the different repository to use.</li>
<li>Make sure that the passenger.list file you created is owned by root (I didn't bother with the chmod command they stated)</li>
<li>Update apt-get: <code>sudo apt-get update</code></li>
<li><p>Install the package: <code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-passenger</code>. This installs passenger version 4.0.50, and it will install a bunch of other packages (16 or so). However, this installs ruby versions 1.9.3 and 2.0.0, which are not the versions we want to use. That leads us to...</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="install-ruby-2.1">Install Ruby 2.1</h2>
<p>As the directions in the <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page use Ruby version 2.1, we want to do that also. Following the directions <a href="http://brightbox.com/blog/2014/01/09/ruby-2-1-ubuntu-packages/">here</a> and <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/452243/what-versions-of-ruby-are-supported-in-14-04">here</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add a new repository: <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng</code></li>
<li>Update apt-get: <code>sudo apt-get update</code></li>
<li>Install Ruby 2.1: <code>sudo apt-get install ruby2.1</code>; this will likely on need to install 2 packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, running <code>/usr/bin/ruby -v</code> should report version 2.1.2 (possibly with a more recent patch level). This matches the Ruby version in the <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page.</p>
<h2 id="configure-passenger">Configure Passenger</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check /etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.conf. The <code>PassengerDefaultRuby</code> line should be using <code>/usr/bin/ruby</code>, which means (assuming the previous section was completed successfully) that Passenger is using Ruby 2.1.2.</li>
<li>In /etc/apache2/sites-available/passenger.conf, add <code>PassengerDefaultUser www-data</code> as the last line inside the <code>&lt;IfModule&gt;</code> clause.</li>
<li>Ensure passenger is enabled for apache: <code>sudo a2enmod passenger</code> (it might already be enabled). We will restart the web server shortly.</li>
<li>Create a new Ruby app in a local direction via <code>rails new myapp</code>, or similar; see the <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page for how to configure Ruby and Rails in a user directory. You will need to configure the database and set the secret_key_base values.</li>
<li><p>Edit your /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file, and add the following lines. Here, <code>/home/rails/myapp</code> is where the Rails app is installed on the local file system, and <code>/rails/railstest</code> is the URL for the Rails app (specifically, it will be at http://server/rails/railstest). In this example, all the rails apps are kept in a <code>rails/</code> directory (and that directory was in the HTML document root, which is likely <code>/var/www/html/</code>), but that need not be the case. The lines to add to 000-default.conf:</p>
<pre><code>RailsEnv development
RailsBaseURI /rails/railstest
&lt;Directory /home/rails/myapp&gt;
  Options -MultiViews
&lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li>In the HTML document root (likely <code>/var/www/html</code>), make that <code>rails</code> sub-directory. In that directory, run <code>ln -s /home/rails/myapp/public railstest</code>, where <code>/home/rails/myapp</code> and <code>railstest</code> are the values from step 5, above.</li>
<li>Reload apache: <code>sudo service apache2 reload</code></li>
<li>View the app at <code>http://localhost/rails/railstest</code>. While it should show a Passenger page, at this point, it should complain about being unable to run bundler/setup (specifically, &quot;cannot load such file -- bundler/setup (LoadError)&quot;).</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo gem install bundler</code></li>
<li><p>Reload <code>http://localhost/rails/railstest</code>. Now it should complain about not <em>having</em> the gems installed, which is a different issue.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem, now, is that all of the gems were installed by the local user via <code>bundle install</code> (or, more likely, <code>bundle install --path vendor/bundle</code>), whcih installs them to the user's own directory. However, the Ruby on Rails that is running on the Apache web server (via Passenger) does not use those gems -- instead, it uses the gems in <code>/var/lib/gems/2.1.0/gems</code> -- and the particular gems needed for that web app have not (yet) been installed.</p>
<p>A few hard ways to manage this before we get to the easy way:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can install gems one-by-one. While this is rather tedious, it will work. In the passenger error page, about 8 lines down, it will say something like, &quot;Could not find rake-10.3.2 in any of the sources (Bundler::GemNotFound)&quot;. That says that the gem that is needed is &quot;rake&quot; and the version is &quot;10.3.2&quot;. So we can install that particular gem via <code>sudo gem install rake -v 10.3.2</code>.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can cd into the Rails app directory (which, in the example above, was /home/rails/myapp), and run <code>bundle install</code> as root.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easist way is to have the users run <code>bundle install --path vendor/bundle</code> instead of <code>bundle install</code>. This will install the gems into their rails app directory (specifically, <code>myapp/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.0/gems/</code>). Passenger will look there for the gems, in addition to the system directory (which is <code>/var/lib/gems/2.1.0/gems</code>). Having them install the gems locally will take up more disk space (maybe 50-100 Mb per user), but will be far easier, as the students can manage their own gems without sudo privledges.</p>
<p>Some packages may complain about not finding /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h -- see the troubleshooting section, below, for how to fix this.</p>
<h2 id="allowing-users-to-reload-apache">Allowing users to reload apache</h2>
<p>Reloading apache needs to be run as root. We will allow all users of a given group to execute these functions; we'll call the group 'rails'.</p>
<p>Compile this file, and call it <code>reload-apache2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main() {
  system(&quot;service apache2 reload&quot;);
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Take that binaries (<code>reload-apache2</code>), and move it to /usr/local/bin/. The run <code>chown root:rails reload-apache2</code> and <code>chown 4750 reload-apache2</code>. These commands mean that anybody who runs that binary (which, in this case, can only be done by somebody in the rails group) will execute those commands AS ROOT.</p>
<p>You can add a user to a group via <code>usermod -a -G rails user</code>, but that user will have to completely log out and log back in for that change to take effect.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-multiple-rails-apps-on-one-server">Deploying multiple Rails apps on one server</h2>
<p>Some of these steps were done in the Passenger configuration section, above.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the HTML document root (which is specified in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf), create a <code>rails/</code> directory (this was the same as discussed in steps 5 and 6 in the Configure Passenger section, above).</li>
<li>In that directory, make symlinks to the public folders of each of the apps you want to have on the server: <code>ln -s ~userid/myapp/public user</code></li>
<li>Edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
<ul>
<li>Add all of this right above the very last <code>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code> line</li>
<li>Add the line: <code>RailsEnv development</code></li>
<li><p>For <strong><em>each</em></strong> rails app to deploy, add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>RailsBaseURI /rails/user
&lt;Directory /home/user/myapp&gt;
  Options -MultiViews
&lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li>Here, <code>/rails/user</code> is the symlink (from the apache2 document root done in step 2, above -- which means the full path to that symlink is likely something like <code>/var/www/html/rails/user</code>), and <code>/home/user/myapp</code> is where the app itself is stored</li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can put all of those 4-line stanzas in a separate file, such as <code>/etc/apache2/rails.conf</code>, and then put in the following two lines into <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</code> (and, presumably, <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf</code>):</p>
<pre><code>RailsEnv development
Include rails.conf</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reload the web server (<code>service apache2 reload</code>)</li>
<li>At this point, you should be able to view your app at <code>http://server/rails/user</code> (and possibly the https version of the URL, if that was configured).</li>
<li>If you swtich from development to production in step 3, the app claims it cannot find the file; see the troubleshooting section, below, for details.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="easy-user-rails-installation">Easy user Rails installation</h2>
<p>This section is intended for those running a server that many users will be setting up Rails apps. If you are just running Rails apps under one account, then this section doesn't apply to you.</p>
<p>To set up Rails, as per the <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page, you have to follow the directions that are listed <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">here</a>. These instructions take about 30 minutes to run, and if anything is done wrong, it will likely mean they have to start over.</p>
<p>Instead, you can run those directions from a given user's directory (user 'rails', for example). It will be easiest if you actually create an app for that user (and use the <code>-d mysql</code> flag when doing so), as that will locally install the gems needed. Then you can tar/gzip the files. To do so, you need to include a number of directories and files:</p>
<pre><code>tar cfz rails-setup.tgz .gem .gemrc .rbenv .subversion bashrc-mods.txt</code></pre>
<p>The first four of the included files/directories (.gem, .gemrc, rbenv, and .subversion) were created by the instructions <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">here</a>. The last one lists the three lines that the users have to add to their end of their .bashrc. Those modifications were also created by <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">those instructions</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="rubyrails-getting-started.html">Ruby on Rails getting started</a> (<a href="rubyrails-getting-started.md">md</a>) page indicates that this file is kept in <code>/usr/local/</code>, and it is how it instructs students to set up Rails in their account.</p>
<p>A few important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>zip/unzip seemed to cause some problems, likely with how symlinks are handled. Or it could have been a user error, but either way, tar/gzip works fine.</li>
<li>That file is likely not portable to other machines unless the configuration is the exact same.</li>
<li><strong>You will still have to keep the rails account</strong>. Many of the paths in the files that you have created via the <code>tar</code> command have hard-coded paths to the <code>rails</code> user. The gems are still installed locally (via <code>bundle install --path vendor/bundle</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="generic-error-with-no-known-cause">Generic error with no known cause</h3>
<p>Rails apps have a log/ directory (such as /home/rails/myapp/log), and therein provide a lot of detail about what is going wrong.</p>
<h3 id="usrlibrubyincluderuby.h-not-found">/usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h not found</h3>
<p>In either case, you may run into a problem when trying to install certain gems -- this happened with the mysql2 gem:</p>
<pre><code>gem install mysql2 -v 0.3.16
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    /usr/bin/ruby2.1 extconf.rb
mkmf.rb can&#39;t find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h

extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /var/lib/gems/2.1.0/gems/mysql2-0.3.16 for inspection.
Results logged to /var/lib/gems/2.1.0/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.1.0/mysql2-0.3.16/gem_make.out</code></pre>
<p>The Ruby development files (and, specifically, /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h), were not installed. To do so, run <code>sudo apt-get install ruby2.1-dev</code>. The &quot;2.1&quot; will install the right set of packages from the repository added earlier in these instructions.</p>
<h3 id="the-page-you-were-looking-for-doesnt-exist">&quot;The page you were looking for doesn't exist&quot;</h3>
<p>This problem seems to occur when running the Rails apps in production mode. For the reason why (and clues how to fix it), see the answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22026492/heroku-rails-setup-the-page-you-were-looking-for-doesnt-exist">here</a></p>
