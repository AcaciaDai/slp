<h1 id="slp-cakephp-getting-started">SLP: CakePHP: Getting Started</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main SLP documents page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>To get a CakePHP website up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your webserver is configured for CakePHP; you need to have URL rewriting turned on. See the <a href="virtualbox-image-details.html">VirtualBox image details</a> (<a href="virtualbox-image-details.md">md</a>) page for how to do this
<ul>
<li>This has already benn configured on both the VirtualBox image and the course server already</li>
<li>You should have installed composer, either locally or globally (it's installed globally on both the VirtualBox image and on the course server)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should have your MySQL datbase and login information ready, as you will need that shortly; you should have gotten that in the Collab Post'Em tool</li>
<li>Install CakePHP, following the directions <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/installation.html#installing-cakephp">here</a>
<ul>
<li>On the course server, it <strong>MUST</strong> be in ~/html/cakephp/, or else we will not be able to find it (and we will not grade it); this means that the final URL will be http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/ (where &quot;server&quot; is the course server)</li>
<li>So we recommend putting it in ~/public_html/cakephp/ on VirtualBox, and ~/html/cakephp/ on the course server.</li>
<li>To do this, run <code>composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app cakephp</code> from your ~/public_html directory (on VirtualBox) or ~/html directory (on the course server)</li>
<li>If your URLs are the same, then you can just do an rsync upload to transfer the files, and they should work on the course server as well; see the <a href="hw-frameworks.html">Frameworks homework</a> (<a href="framework-hw.md">md</a>) for details about rsync</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configure the CakePHP installation
<ul>
<li>There are <strong><em>TWO</em></strong> .htaccess files (in the root CakePHP directory (~mst3k/html/cakephp/) and in the webroot directly below that (~mst3k/html/cakephp/webroot/)), and both will need to be edited and a line like <code>RewriteBase /~mst3k/cakephp/</code> put in (edited for your particular directory/URL). Put this in as the second to last line, just above the <code>&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code> line.</li>
<li>At this point, you should be able to view your URL, although it will indicate that it cannot connect to the database</li>
<li>In config/app.php, edit app.php, and edit the Datasources =&gt; default array: you will need to change the values for username, password, and database to match your MySQL credentials (both username and database are your userid for this homework; your password is from above)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At this point, you should be able to view the page. It should look <strong>exactly</strong> like the image below
<ul>
<li>Obviously, &quot;server&quot; is the course server</li>
<li>Note that all the check marks are green! If <strong>ANY</strong> of them are yellow or red, then something is wrong, and it is not configured properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>If you are getting &quot;internal server error&quot;, &quot;Not Found&quot;, or &quot;404: File Not Found&quot; messages when viewing your CakePHP site, there are two things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure your .htaccess file has the RewriteBase line added</li>
<li>view the Apache error logs - see the <a href="linux-admin-howtos.html">Linux Administration Howtos</a> (<a href="linux-admin-howtos.md">md</a>) page for how to do this</li>
</ul>
