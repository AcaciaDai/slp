SLP: Django: Getting Started
============================

[Go up to the main SLP documents page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

To install Django, under Ubuntu 14.04, just enter `apt-get install python-django`, and it will do the rest.  As of the writing of this tutorial (Aug 31, 2014), this installs Python version 2.7.6 and Django version 1.6.1.
