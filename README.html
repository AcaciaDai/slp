<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using Markdown. Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old (2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as tables. Indeed, the default Ubuntu version of Markdown is the 2004 version. To address this, a <a href="utils/markdown.cpp.html">markdown.cpp</a> (<a href="utils/markdown.cpp">src</a>) program was written to use more recent Markdown features. This program uses the libmarkdown library, which does support more recent Markdown features. This library installed on Ubuntu via the 'libmarkdown2-dev' package. Note that reveal.js, which is used for the slides, also supports more modern Markdown features. That being said, the extra Markdown features used in this repository should be compatible with the generally accepted Markdown features.</p>
<p>To compile: &quot;gcc markdown.c -o markdown -lmarkdown&quot;. To use, specify the input file name, and optionally an output file. The resulting document is a full HTML document -- meaning it adds the doctype, html, head, and body tags to the document, as necessary.</p>
<p>For all the Markdown files, both the original (.md) file and the HTML version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this repository.</p>
