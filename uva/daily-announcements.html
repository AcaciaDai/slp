## Monday, February 9th, 2015, page 1
- We are starting iteration 9
  - The deliverable for this iteration is the [master test plan](../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/mastertestplan), which we will go over today
  - As well as the normal 24-28 story points worth of "stuff"
  - You may need to update your deployment plan during this iteration...
- Seven person groups just had a *phase change*
  - This means new leads and secretaries, as well as the end-of-phase survey
  - Incoming leads were emailed about this earlier today
  - And the survey prompt was also sent then as well
    - This needs to be filled out in a timely manner (about a week)
- Iteration 7 evaluations are out, but attendance is not yet entered
  - Any concerns need to be brought up within two weeks of when it was returned (i.e., two weeks after Monday, 2/2)
- We are aiming to have iteration 8 evals out early next week
- A note about the deliverables: you will have to follow what is detailed in the [deliverables](../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html) slide set exactly...

## Monday, February 9th, 2015, page 2
- Installation notes
  - The system needs to be fully deployed, to the deployment host, at the end of the development phase (March 23rd)
  - However, I will want a version deployed one iteration earlier (March 9th)
    - Whatever the current state is at that point
  - I just wanted to give you a heads-up so it does not come as a surprise later on...
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00
  - Although they will be 2:00-3:30 today
- Leads: your TPS reports were due yesterday by noon; details [here](../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/tpsreport)
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
- Customer meetings in 1 line: reports (1 sentence) but not w/Jamie; name tags
- Don't forget to report your hours!!! This is a course requirement!
- Today is a lecture on [testing](../slides/spring/03-testing.html), which will likely finish next Wednesday

## Server hack
- The [ZmEu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZmEu_%28vulnerability_scanner%29) malware succesfully attacked the course server on Monday, February 9th
  - It likely got access through a weak password in phpmyadmin
  - From there, a vulnerability in phpmyadmin allowed console access
- Even though the system was fully updated, the installed version of phpmyadmin (4.0.10) is well below the most recent version (4.3.9)
  - It's unclear if the exploit was a weak password or a bug in phpmyadmin that has since been fixed
- The server was allowed to be reconnected to the network this morning
  - Assuming the malware was properly removed, it should stay up for the foreseeable future
- Some of your processess - and all of your login shells -- were terminated as a result of all of this
- Consequence: phpmyadmin has been disabled
  - And likely will not be enabled again this semester
  - You will have to use the command-line mysql client

## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 26th)
- So that we can find it, please make a `docs/` directory in the root of your github repo, and put it there (in PDF or Markdown format)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed (URL, provider, etc.)
    - Alternatively: AWS, Heroku, customer's machine, etc.
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?  Credentials?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - You should start an email conversation with the customer about all this; said email conversation is likely sufficient
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
- You should also include whatever indicators you have that the customer understands that s/he will have to acquire this, if appropriate

## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 26th)
- So that we can find it, please make a `docs/` directory in the root of your github repo, and put it there (in PDF or Markdown format)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed (URL, provider, etc.)
    - Alternatively: AWS, Heroku, customer's machine, etc.
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?  Credentials?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - You should start an email conversation with the customer about all this; said email conversation is likely sufficient
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
- You should also include whatever indicators you have that the customer understands that s/he will have to acquire this, if appropriate
