## Wednesday, March 25th, 2015
- We are at the start of iteration 12: system development should be complete!
  - 6 person groups just had a phase change; the survey prompt was sent out last night
  - Transition period deliveriables will be on the next few slides
- Leads: your TPS reports were due yesterday by noon; details [here](../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/tpsreport)
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
- There was a delay allowed for the 90% testing code coverage; that delay is one week (i.e., until the end of next Monday)
  - Really we are just going to look if you hit 100% by the end of the current iteration
- Note that we must be able to run the unit tests on the course server!
  - We were unable to do so on some of the groups' accounts
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00
- Customer meetings in 1 line: reports (1 sentence) but not w/Jamie; name tags
- Don't forget to report your hours!!! This is a course requirement!
- Today is a group work day
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## End of Development Checklist
- Updated transition plan documents, code coverage at 90%
- Updated requirements documents
- The system meets all the requirements
- Github issues "trimmed": only those that are actually going to be handled during transition should remain
  - No major feature development issues should remain
- CI status is green (it wasn't as of last night for 2 groups)
- System deployed to final deployment host
- Customer is aware of the deployed system, and will start using it
- TPS report submitted; it MUST contain the URL of the deployed site
- *New:* credentials sent to Jamie/Bloomfield to log in to *both* servers (pegasus and deployed site)
  - You can submit this as an "other" report for the current iteration, even if you have already given them to us

## Transition Period Overview
- <font color='red'>YOUR CUSTOMER MUST BE USING THE SYSTEM!!!</font>
  - If not, and you and I are not in discussion about this, it will be considered a failure to properly deploy the system -- which means you will not have completed the entire point of this course
  - I will be emailing all the customers later this week to remind them to use the system
- There are many deliverables due during the transition period (described next)
- You must still be "tweaking" your system: implementing any fixes (or minor changes) that the customer requests

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- Alzheimers: issues #29, #159, #165, #171
- Band: issue #16

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points

  - As well as the normal 24-28 story points worth of "stuff"
  - You may need to update your deployment plan during this iteration...
- Six person groups just had a *phase change*
  - New leads and new secretaries
  - Those groups must fill out the end-of-phase survey (it's a course requirement)
  - Survey prompts were sent out during Monday's class
- Compatability testing: you should test your system on *multiple* browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari)
- Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; details [here](../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/weeklyreport)

## Schedule changes moving forward
- As mentioned on the first day of the spring semester, there will only be Wednesday lectures for about the first half of the semester

  - There isn't much I can lecture to you about that:
    1. Will be of use to you as you wrap up your projects, and
    2. Won't be a waste of your time
- There is one more definite lecture ([maintenance](../slides/spring/04-maintenance.html)), as well as a few other things: guest talk, course conclusions, presentations etc.
- But most of the following Wednesdays will now become group work days
  - Thus, there will be two group work days each week: Mondays and Wednesdays

- WTJU: issue #156

  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
- Seven person groups had a *phase change* one week ago
  - Surveys are now over due!  Except Jaunt, who I just added yesterday...
- Iteration 8 evaluations evals have been released (attendance is not yet entered); concerns need to be raised within 2 weeks
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00, but not today (chat with me after class if you were going to swing by)

## Master Test Plan versus Code Coverage Report
- The original idea, as presented in the [deliverables slide set](../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html), was to submit the [code coverage report](../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/codecoverage) instead of the [master test plan](../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/mastertestplan) this iteration
  - I sneakily changed it; the reason was to give you more time to write your unit tests for the code coverage report
- Some have asked that that order be reversed
- That's fine, with the following caveats:
  - If you are submitting the code coverage report this iteration, then you *still* need to submit a `docs/master-test-plan.md` (or .pdf) file that has one line: "we are submitting the code coverage report this iteration instead"
    - This way we know you didn't forget
  - You still need to hit the 80% target for code coverage

- Installation notes
  - The system needs to be fully deployed, to the deployment host, at the end of the development phase (March 23rd)
  - However, I will want a version deployed one iteration earlier (March 9th)
    - Whatever the current state is at that point
  - I just wanted to give you a heads-up so it does not come as a surprise later on...
- My office hours are M/W 1:30-3:00

## Server hack
- The [ZmEu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZmEu_%28vulnerability_scanner%29) malware succesfully attacked the course server on Monday, February 9th
  - It likely got access through a weak password in phpmyadmin
  - From there, a vulnerability in phpmyadmin allowed console access
- Even though the system was fully updated, the installed version of phpmyadmin (4.0.10) is well below the most recent version (4.3.9)
  - It's unclear if the exploit was a weak password or a bug in phpmyadmin that has since been fixed
- The server was allowed to be reconnected to the network this morning
  - Assuming the malware was properly removed, it should stay up for the foreseeable future
- Some of your processess - and all of your login shells -- were terminated as a result of all of this
- Consequence: phpmyadmin has been disabled
  - And likely will not be enabled again this semester
  - You will have to use the command-line mysql client

## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 26th)
- So that we can find it, please make a `docs/` directory in the root of your github repo, and put it there (in PDF or Markdown format)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed (URL, provider, etc.)
    - Alternatively: AWS, Heroku, customer's machine, etc.
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?  Credentials?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - You should start an email conversation with the customer about all this; said email conversation is likely sufficient
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
- You should also include whatever indicators you have that the customer understands that s/he will have to acquire this, if appropriate
