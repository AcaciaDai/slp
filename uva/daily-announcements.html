- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sXO8Ha1fM2EH39Pq1fYeKz8CyYi3tRfMMU0hYF8TjYw/viewform) by Friday of this week

## Homeworks
- The [git/github homework](../docs/hw-git.html) is due Friday, Sept 4th, by noon
  - We are going to look at the times you submitted everything to github
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `wasiuva` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- Next up is a three-part [Frameworks homework](../docs/hw-frameworks.html), where you individually develop a basic system using each of the three platforms we will be using:
  - CakePHP (3.0) running on PHP (5.5.9): due Monday, Septmeber 7th, by noon
    - See the [CakePHP: getting started](../docs/cakephp-getting-started.html) page
  - Ruby (2.2.3) on Rails (4.2.3): due Friday, September 11th, by noon
    - THIS PART IS NOT YET READY, SO DON'T START IT YET
  - Django (1.8.4) on Python (2.7.6 or 3.4.0): due Monday, September 14th , by noon
    - THIS PART IS NOT YET READY, SO DON'T START IT YET
  - Account information will be out "soon" (later today, I hope)
  - The intent is to introduce you to each platform so that you may make an educated decision as to which one you prefer for the project
  - There are lots of useful documents on the [documents page in the repo](../docs/index.html)
- The year-start survey will be out Monday, September 14th, and will need to be completed by Friday, September 18th

## Friday, August 28th, 2015
- The [first homework, on git and github](../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due next Friday (Sep 4th) by the start of lecture (12 noon)
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `wasiuva` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- There will be 1-2 more HWs each successive week, then the projects start
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab ([direct link](../docs/virtualbox-intro.html)); also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
  - Be aware that VirtualBox version 5.0 and above does NOT work; instead, install the latest 4.3 version
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sXO8Ha1fM2EH39Pq1fYeKz8CyYi3tRfMMU0hYF8TjYw/viewform) by Friday of next week
  - Did you get an email about that?
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- Today we will finish the [course introduction](course-introduction-fall.html#/) and start on [development methodologies](../slides/01-development-methods.html#/)
