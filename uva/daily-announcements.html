  - Details can be found in the fall [course introduction slide set](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html), specifically [here](../../slides/fall/01-intro.html#weeklyreport)

## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 26th)
- So that we can find it, please make a docs/ directory in the root of your github repo, and put it there (in PDF or Markdown format)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed (URL, provider, etc.)
    - Alternatively: AWS, Heroku, customer's machine, etc.
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?  Credentials?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - You should start an email conversation with the customer about all this; said email conversation is likely sufficient
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
- You should also include whatever indicators you have that the customer understands that s/he will have to acquire this, if appropriate

## Github Story Points<br>Hall of Shame

Remember that *all* issues (even closed ones) must have a story points tag.  The following do not:

&nbsp;

- Arbor: issue #113
- Innisfree: issue #53

&nbsp;

You can give a tag of "story-points-none" if the task is not worth any story points
