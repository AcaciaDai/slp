===================================================

a.k.a. Capstone Practicum I (CS 4970) and Capstone Practicum II (CS 4971)

### Fall 2014 & Spring 2015
### Fall 2014: M/W/F 10:00-10:50, Rice 130
### Spring 2015: location TBA

**Instructor:** [Aaron Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb) / [aaron@virginia.edu](mailto:aaron@virginia.edu) / [\@bloomfieldaaron](http://twitter.com/bloomfieldaaron).  Office is Rice Hall, room 403.  Office hours are M/W 2:00-3:30.

**Course Description:** The Service Learning Practicum course involves the application of software engineering and computing principles to the development of a complete software system for non-profit organizations in our community. Students will be expected to work through the entire software system development process, including customer interfacing for requirements, detailed design, and a comprehensive maintenance plan.

**Prerequisites:** CS 2150 with a grade of C- or above.  Ideally you have taken (or are taking) 3240 (Advanced Software Development) or CS 4240 (Object Oriented Design), but those are not required.  Instructor permission is required to enroll in the course, however.

**Course objectives:** Students who complete the course sequence will:
- Have gained experience with the development of large software projects through all phases from inception through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- Be able to design a customized development methodology for a particular project with given specifications
- Understand customer interaction for a software development project
- Understand proper documentation generation for a software development project
- Be able to properly generate, use, and understand the importance of various artifacts: use cases, requirements documents, etc.

**Meetings:** This course is a practicum, and not a primarily lecture-based course.  Thus, the course meetings will be quite different.  On any given week, we expect to have a group meeting day on Monday, lecture on Wednesday, and no class on Fridays; both Monday and Wednesday classes are in the lecture class room.  Note that there will be some weeks where we will have lectures on Mondays and Fridays, such as the first few weeks.

**Participation:** Participation is vital to this course.  You must participate in the lecture (i.e., by attending) and in your project and group meetings.  You must participate in the work of the group -- this means that **everybody** must contribute to the code base.

**Grades:** See the [first slide set](../slides/fall/01-intro.html) for details.  This course is not being graded on a bell curve, which means that everybody could receive an A.  Likewise, everybody could receive a D.  Failure to produce a viable and working software system -- in either December (for CS 4970) or May (for CS 4971) -- will result in either an **incomplete or failure for the entire group**.  Note that for the 4th year BS CS majors, this will prevent May graduation.

**Special Circumstances:** Students with special circumstances (athletics, extra time required on exams, LNEC considerations, etc.) need to let me know during the **first week of class**.

**Textbooks:** None; however, you may still have to purchase something (see the Github section, below).

**Assignments:** For the first few weeks, there will be individual homeworks, about 1 per week.  Once the projects are assigned in late September, the rest of the assignments will effectively be project milestones.

**Exams:** None planned.  I reserve the write to add one if I feel like I want to spend some time grading.  There will be an individual project in lieu of the final exam.

**Github:** We will be using [github](https://github.com) for source code management.  The projects will be kept in private repositories, which will be provided to you at no cost.  However, for your individual homeworks, you will need to acquire 2 private repositories.  Students can get those for free, although you must give them a week or so to process your request.  If you have used all of yours, or if you wait until the last minute to request your free private repos, then you will have to purchase some.  The private repos will need to be kept until the assignment is graded and returned.

**Time Tracking:** Time tracking: each student must keep very careful track of the number of hours s/he works on the project.  This must be totaled by week.  This is not expect to take very long to do (say, 2 minutes each week), but must be done carefully from the beginning of the course.  More info on this during the first lecture.

**Honor Policy:** Standard UVa honor policy.  For this course, that means using other code without appropriate attribution.
