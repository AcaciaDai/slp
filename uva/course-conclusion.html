# Remaining Work
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What you have to do to get outta here...
- The remaining tasks are all described on the following slides
- They include:
  - If you didn't complete the specific tests from iteration 13, they need to be completed!
  - Complete the iteration 14 checklist
  - Documentation in the proper format
  - Github repo clean-up
  - Hand-off to the customer
  - Completion of the surveys
- A few other things are at the very end of this slide set (in the [Conclusion](#/conclusion))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration 14 checklist
(this is what is due during this current iteration)

- Individual tutorial (completed)
- Screen shots
- One slide version
- All tests must pass (including green CI status and being able to run the tests on the course server)
- At the end: end-of-phase AND end-of-year surveys
  - FYI, these need to be completed, else incompletes will be issued  :-(
- All github issues trimmed
- Leads must still submit both reports, including a TPS report!
- Final hand-off to myself and the customer
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation
- Your documentation needs to be in a standard state -- both so that I can ensure that everything is present, and to help me find things for the customer
- Pretty much everything will need to be in ***TWO*** formats: .md (or whatever source you used) and .pdf (so the customer can read them)
  - If you used Google Docs (or similar), that's fine -- just save a .odt (or whatever) version in the repo
- If some of the documenmts are elsewhere in the repo, create a one-line document of the appropriate name that just states where the document can be found
  - This is most likely to occur with the programming reference and/or installation instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Document files I will look for
- technical-report.???/pdf
- user-manual.md/pdf
- installation-instructions.md/pdf
- programming-reference.md/pdf
- requirements-document.md/pdf
- deployment-plan.md/pdf
- master-test-plan.md/pdf
- specific-test-plans.md/pdf
- coverage/index.html (and the entire coverage/ directory)
- code-coverage-excuses.md (optional; see [here](../slides/spring/03-testing.html#/codecoverageslacking))
- final-presentation.???/pdf
- one-slide.pptx
- screenshot*.png
- readme.md (see [here](../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html#/readmemd))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation, continued
- This should all be in the `docs/` directory in your github repo
- An automated script will be looking for all those things, so please follow the naming conventions there
  - And as we are all computer scientists, so let's get the cApItAlIzAtIoN case correct
  - And, really, who puts spaces in file names these days?
- I am happy to "pre-check" all this for you, so that you don't run into any last-minute surprises
  - Just send me an email asking me to check your docs/ directory to make sure everything is correct
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation, continued, continued
- Note that if any of these documents are LaTeX, put those files in an appropriately named sub-directory
  - i.e., `technical-report/`, `programming-reference/`, etc.
- You can use pandoc to convert markdown to PDF:
  - Install the package, if it's not already: `sudo apt-get install pandoc`
  - The command to convert it is:
```
pandoc -f markdown --smart -o file.pdf file.md
```
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github repo cleanup
- Your github repo should be in a reasonable state -- remember that other people may work on your project
- In particular:
  - Reasonable directory structure
    - Example: if you have a bagillion data files in the root directory (I know who you are!), then put them in a data/ sub-directory
  - All issues either resolved, or we have talked about it (an open issue means you did not complete something)
    - That being said, you can have future enhancements listed as github issues
  - Other than the master branch, the other branches should all have a specific purpose (i.e., clean up your branches)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hand-off to the customer
- This is described more fully [here](../slides/spring/02-deliverables.html#/customer)
- In particular (but read the full description):
  - Email them thanking them for the whole process
  - Include some documentation and other attachments, and briefly describe them
  - CC me when you do so
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Completion of the surveys
- There are two!
  - One is the usual end-of-phase survey
- The other is a (rather extensive) end-of-year survey
  - One question is whether you would be willing to be contacted in the future for support issues
    - There is no pressure to answer this one way or the other!
  - Part of your grade will depend on you completing this survey well
    - This does ***NOT*** mean sycophantic, flatting answers!  It means taking the time to write thoughtful responses
    - More details [here](#/filloutsurveys)
- The survey prompts will be sent out later this week (Thursday or Friday)
- Both must be completed!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Show stoppers
- Any of the following will prevent the *entire* group from completing this course:
  - Not having all the tests completed and working
    - This includes the specific tests from iteration 13, as well as a green CI status badge
  - Not having cleaned up the github repo
  - Not having the documentation in the correct format
  - Not having handed off the project to the customer
  - Not having completed all the things from the checklists from iterations 12, 13, and 14
  - Not having a working system (yes, I have to say that...)
- The following will prevent you, specifically, from completing this course:
  - Not completing the two remaining surveys

## Burndown charts
- Remember I had you estimate all the tasks at the beginning of the year?
- The purpose was to illustrate how difficult estimation really is
- Let's compare a sample burndown chart with our charts...

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lessons learned...
- Estimates are rarely accurate
- Estimation is quite difficult to do
- If this were a paid project, we would have spent much more time on estimation than we did
  - (not that I think *we* should have spent more time...)
  - For a commercial project, a poor estimate can bankrupt a company!
- Generating proper estimates require an experienced person (possibly a consultant)
- We did better this year than in past years!

## Github issues
- As of last night, there were 2,859 total issues across all 15 projects
  - Low of 104 for one group, high of 447
  - This does not count pull requests
- That's about 191 per project, on average

## Git statistics
- As of last night, there were 10,889 total commits for all 15 groups

  - This is for all branches, and includes merge commits
- That's about 726 commits per group, on average
  - About 52 per iteration
  - About 9 per person per iteration (assuming a 6 person group)

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Git observations
- Only 304 commits resolved (or closed or fixed) an issue via a commit message
  - Out of 10,889 commit messages, that's only 2.8%

- There was not a single commit with any sort of profanity
- Some commit messages follow

## Disclaimer
- Again, as the current iteration (#14) is not yet complete, the data for the following slides is thus also not yet complete
- What follows are the *reported* hours, which I know is not the same as *actual* hours.  But it's all I have to go by...
- Some groups had people drop out, which affect the totals on the next page
- So take it with a big grain of salt...

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## I have kept my word...

The numerical amount of hours you submitted has never, and will never, be used as a factor in your grade
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reported hours analysis
- Total was 10,102.6 hours
- Average was 673.5 hours per group
  - It was 657 hours per group last year
- Which is 48.1 hours per (two-week) iteration
- Which is 8.0 hours per student per (two-week) iteration (assuming a 6-person group)
- Which is 4.0 hours per student per week
- At $100 per hour (a reasonable consulting rate), that's $67,350 "given" to the community per project
- Or $1,010,260 overall (over $1 million!)
- Even if we charge half that, it's still a very significant sum
	  </script></section>

<!-- To obtain the data for the next slide:

- Generated the reported times table
- Get a list of all students that are no longer in the course
- The total reported times should be n*i where n is the number of students and i is the number of iterations
- Verify that (modfiy the date and the usernames, of course):

select * from reported_times where start_date>"2014-07-01" and username!="mst3k" and username!="mst4k";

- Now, count how many were missing:

select * from reported_times where start_date>"2014-07-01" and count=0 and count_late=0 and username!="mst3k" and username!="mst4k";

-->

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Can we do better?
- 205 (of 14*97 = 1358) iterations did not have any hours reported
  - Due to not entering hours; entering zero hours is not counted here
  - 70 of those are from the current iteration 14, which has not been required to be reported yet
- Can we assume that those iterations had work done?  Sure, why not
  - Some of those are from people who totally slacked off, but others (I know) did not report all their hours; but we'll scale it down all the same
- 205/1358 = 15.1%, which we'll scale down to 10% -- so we can increase all our estimates by that much
- That yields $74,085 given per project (round to $74k)
- And $1,111,286 overall (round to $1.1 million)

## Course Objectives
Students who complete the course will:

- have gained experience with the development of large software projects through all phases from inception through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance
- be able to design a customized development methodology for a particular project with given specifications
- understand customer interaction for a software development project
- understand proper documentation generation for a software development project
- be able to properly generate, use, and understand the importance of various artifacts: use cases, requirements documents, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What didn't work well
- Deployment was still slow, even though it started even earlier this year than previous years
  - A fix is on deck for that one...
- CakePHP's slooooooooow release of the 3.0 API
- The increased load on the teaching faculty meant I could not prepare as many lectures as I had intended
- The increased course size meant I could not follow the projects as closely as I would have liked
- The 9 a.m. meeting time in the spring was not super popular...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What did work well
- We developed 15 projects for the customers!
- And it seems that all of them will be used by the nonprofits
- Django, as a platform, was well received and (generally) bug free
- Having a grad TA really helped everything move along smoothly
- You (hopefully) gained some real-world experience
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes for next year
- I estimate about 80 students (down from about 100 this year)
- All new projects!
- Use of [waffle.io](http://waffle.io)
- A full legal agreement with the customers
  - This has already been written, and be presented up front this time
- Likely no new platforms, although the verions will probably be updated
- Deployment even earlier (December)
- More lectures, especially during the spring
- I might bring back mentors next year

## Final exam grade
- In addition to the tutorial, it is partly based on your completion of the end-of-year survey
- I'm not looking for sycophantic answers!
  - I'm looking for your honest opinions
  - And I want constructive criticism, as that is what will help me improve the SLP
- I'm going to be looking that you:
  - Completed the survey
  - Took time to respond to (some, if not all) of the fill-in questions
- Please don't add fluff or flattery or anything else like that; it just wastes both our times
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is left for you to do
- Leads: fill out your weekly report today, and your TPS reports next Monday
- Fill out the end-of-phase survey (survey prompt to follow later this week)
- Fill out the end-of-year survey (survey prompt to follow later this week)
  - I'm really interested in your comments!
  - And if you get a survey time-out, I can provide you with your previous answers
  - I'll put the survey pages online so you can see the questions ahead of time
- Tutorials!  I hope you have a topic...
- Fill out the Collab course evaluations
- Complete the stuff mentioned in the beginning of this slide set
- And...
