# Survey Statistics
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Stats
- Most popular projects:
  - Highest project had 26 people select it as their first choice
  - Next highest project had 24
  - Third highest project had 10
- Obviously, not all first choice requests could be honored...
- 12 projects have 7 people; 3 have 6 people
  - Which ones was due to balancing the preferences
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- 49 (out of 102) got their first choice project: 48.0%
- Only 11 (out of 102) got a project rated *lower* than their first choice project: 10.8%
  - Of those 11 individuals, 10 of them ended up on a project they rated as a 4, when their first choice was rated a 5
    - The other individual rated one project a 5 and the rest as 3, so there wasn't much to work with there...
  - Note that for one group of 6, their first choice was to work together, and not on a specific project
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Platform Preferences
- Average overall platform preference: 3.27
  - Preferences: cake: 3.23; rails: 3.00; django: 3.59
- Average favorite platform preference: 3.96
- If the expected platforms are chosen, then only 3 people got a platform they rated as a 2
  - But in all three cases, those were people that rated the project preference higher than, or equal to, the platform preference
- Expected platform count: django: 7, cake: 4, ruby: 4 
- Average team preference for expected platform: 3.70
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Friends and Enemies
- Nobody got his/her mortal enemies
  - I had to do some re-arranging for that
- I tried to preserve BFFs
  - This worked best when the BFFs all seleted each other, and had the same project/platform choices
  - In many cases, because the project/platform choices were dissimilar, the BFF choices could not be followed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## MySQL knowledge
- One team has a maximum MySQL knowledge of 3
  - Although there are 5 people on that team with that level of knowledge
- Every other team has a maximum MySQL knowledge of 4 or 5 (7 teams each)
- Average MySQL knowledge overall was 2.94
- Average max team MySQL knowledge was 4.40

# Project assignments
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Assignments
- It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
- The other members in your group, as well as their UVa userids, can be found in the PostEm tool
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tag
- Each project has a *tag* -- a short, single word -- which is the name for the project
  - This was shown after your name in the listing just shown
- This tag can be found in the Collab PostEm tool
- This tag is used for:
  - The name of your github repo (http://github/uva-slp/tag)
  - The account login on the server -- and thus part of the URL
    - The exact URL will depend on the platform you are using
  - The basis for the DB password on the server (it's actually `slp_tag`)
  - Generally how your project will be referred to

# Next Steps

  - Note that the last half of iteration 14 is during finals week
  - Note that the end of iteration 10, and the start of 11, is during spring break
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- Fall semester: 6 iterations
  - Each phase will be two iterations long
  - Phase 1 is iterations 1-2, phase 2 is iterations 3-4, and phase 3 is iterations 5-6
- Spring semester: 8 iterations
  - Phase sizes will differ depending on the group size
  - For 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases
    - Phase 4 is iterations 7-9, phase 5 is iterations 10-11, and phase 6 is iterations 12-14
  - For 7 person groups, there will be 4 phases
    - Phase 4 is iterations 7-8, phase 5 is iterations 9-10, phase "5.5" is iterations 11-12, and phase 6 is iterations 13-14
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project leadership roles
- Everybody will be lead for one phase and secretary for another
- Restrictions
  - Nobody can have two leadership roles in the fall
    - Thus, 7 person groups will have one person that has both roles in the spring
  - You can not be the lead and secretary for the same iteration
- You must decide today who is the lead and secretary for the *entire* year
  - You can change this later, subject to the restrictions above, by emailing me
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pick leadership roles
- How you pick is completely up to you
- If you can't decide, then I propose the following:
  - Sort everybody by (formal) first names in *reverse* order, and that is the order of the leads
  - The 4th person in that list is the first secretary, and it cycles through
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Leads
- Responsilbe for submitting reports
  - We will see the custom app for submitting them on Wednesday or next Monday; first report is not due until next week
- Responsible for reserving the rooms, creating the agenda for the meeting, and keeping the meeting on track
- This is an *administrative* role, not an *authoritative* one
- At the start of one's time as project lead, I send them an email summarizing their duties
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserving rooms
- You can reserve a Rice Hall conference room in one of three ways:
  - By swinging by Rice 527 (the main CS office)
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in my capstone course
  - By emailing office@cs.virginia.edu
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in my capstone course
  - By asking me during my office hours
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in my capstone course
      - Wait, what?
    - I'm too slow at responding to e-mails to have reservations that way...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Secretary
- This is the person who will take notes at each meeting
- Each meeting (of all types) MUST have notes!
  - This is how I am going to be able to keep up with all the projects
  - Notes should include who was present
- They should be entered into the Github wiki
  - We are all CS majors, and we can all create wiki sub-pages
- The secretary will rotate through everybody, just like the project lead
  - And the secretary can not be the project lead in the same iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remember to report time
- Keep track of ALL time you expend for this course
  - Meetings (customer and not), learning CakePHP, etc.
- The only things you should NOT include are Monday's group meetings and Wednesday's lecture
- This is to be reported via the custom app that I will show you on Wednesday
  - Recall that you grade will NEVER depend (one way or the other) on how much time you report
  - But there WILL be a grade penalty if you do enter an amount of time
  - You can report 0 hours (you really shouldn't, by the way) to avoid the grade penalty
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scheduling the first meeting
- You (the project lead) should contact the customer listed in the requirements document
  - <font color="red">But not before I give the go-ahead, as I want to talk to them first!</font>
  - I expect that to be later today or early tomorrow.
- But you should really wait until after Wednesday's lecture to *have* the meeting
- Then arrange an initial meeting
  - A note about travel...
  - You may not be able to meet this week, due to scheduling issues
- Secretary: remember to take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Emaling the customer
- Wait until I give the go ahead!
- Introduce yourself, and tell them that you are on the project team that will be working on their SLP project
  - Their emails are in the requirements document
- Be polite and professional!
- Propose some times to meet, based on the team's schedule
  - But be open to other meeting times
  - And mention any travel restrictions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuff on my todo list...
- At some point today or tomorrow you will receive from me:
  - A e-mail from me that is the go-ahead to contact the customer
  - Updated pegasus account information (in particular, the group account information)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 1
- Fully understand the requirements
  - Generate questions to ask the customer!
  - This may mean that the requirements document is updated or changed; the original source version is in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects)
- Meet with the customer
  - As the questions that you generated!
- Design a basic DB schema
  - And enter it into your pegasus group DB, or generate the forms via Rails or Django
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 2
- Get a basic MVC website working (CRUD operations for the schema tables)
  - This should all be working on pegasus by the end of the iteration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo
  - You are all members of your respective repos
  - I will give directions for initalizing the repo later this week
  - ***PASSWORDS ARE NOT TO BE STORED IN THE REPO***
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues
  - We'll talk about this in an upcoming class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Nametags
- I am going to give each group a set of "Hello, my name is..." nametags
  - Do *not* fill in "Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
- And a Sharpie marker for each group
  - They are too hard to read when written in pen or pencil
- You are to use these in each of the *customer* meetings until you run out
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## For the rest of today's lecture
- Split off into groups
  - Select leads and a secretaries for the year
  - Select a platform, if you can decide on one today
  - Fill out that information on the [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../uva/project-start-info-sheet.pdf), and turn that in before you leave
- Look over the requirements document
- Generate a list of questions and clarifications that you want to get from the customer
  - The secretary should take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting your groups
- I selected meeting locations for each group
  - It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/meeting-locations.html)
- And if you forgot your project assignment already, that's in this [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
