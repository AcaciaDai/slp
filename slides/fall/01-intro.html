## Course Introduction

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Background
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirement change
- In January of 2013, a new requirement was created for the BS CS degree:
  - All students must complete 3 credits of a capstone course: either CS 4971 (the second half of this sequence) or CS 4980 (for independent projects)
  - CS 4970 (this course) counts as a CS elective
- This requirement is now live in SIS
- While already declared majors do not have to complete this requirement, there will be far fewer faculty willing to advise independent projects due to this requirement
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Capstone Practicum I & II description
“This course is one option in the CS Senior Thesis track. Under the Practicum track, students will take two 3-credit courses, CS 4970 and CS 4971. These courses would form a year-long group-based and project-based practicum class. There would be an actual customer, which could be either internal (the course instructor, other CS professors, etc.) or external (local companies, local non-profits, etc.).”
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Implementation
- The wording is vague so as to allow each instructor to choose how they want to run the capstone
- My implementation is the Service Learning Practicum (SLP) where the students develop software projects for local nonprofits
- I will use "SLP", "Capstone Practicum", and "CS 4970/4971" interchangably
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## This slide set is dense...
- There is a LOT of course structure described in these slides
- I will remind you of the necessary parts as they come to pass
  - So you don't have to have all the due dates memorized
  - But you should be sure to understand everything
- It is all available online as well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A rule for this course
- Please turn off all social media and chats during lecture
- I am going to try not to waste your time
  - Don't waste mine by not paying attention
- You can only have your computer open if it is directly course-related
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## git Repository
- All the course materials will be kept in a (public) github repository: [github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp](http://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp)
  - You can view that material online directly at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/
  - The tentative lecture schedule is there as well (the list of slide sets)
- You will all need to use git for the course, and we will be using github exclusively
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A github note
- The first homework, out next class, is an introduction to git and github (https://github.com), for which you will need two ***private*** repositories
    - We will only need them for a month or two in the fall
- First, if you don't already have one, you should create a github account, as you'll need it for this course
- Then, request the student discount at https://education.github.com/; this will take a week or so to be processed
- You should do this ***today***, due to the week-long delay in processing it
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course syllabus
- It is availabe in the github repo; you can click [here](../../uva/syllabus.html) to view it
- It contains all the information covered in this slide set, plus some more stuff

# Who
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Teams
- Students will be in groups of size of 6 or 7, and assigned to a given project
  - That will be the project (and the group) for the entire academic year!
- Group and project assignment will be based on your survey responses
- That survey will attempt to ensure that you do not end up in a group -- or on a project -- that you do not want to be in
- You will be able to specify any "mortal enemies" that you have in the class
  - i.e., somebody you don't want to work with
- But I can make no guarantees...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project lead
- This is one of the team members who does some of the coordination for the team
  - It's an administrative position, not an authoritative one!
- Lead responsibilities:
  - Deal with meeting scheduling
  - Move the meetings along
  - Submit reports (more on this later)
  - Be the single point of contact for the team
- The lead will rotate through all the group members throughout the academic year
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Secretary
- The other leadership position in each group
- S/he takes notes at each meeting and enters them into the github wiki
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Consensus
- The goal of these projects is for all decisions to be made through a consensus of the group members
- This may not always be possible, but it makes for a far more enjoyable experience
- If there is a major disagreement, then it is my job to help resolve it
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Customers
- A representative from each of the nonprofits will be part of each group
- Sometimes the executive director, but often the staff member who most has to deal with the issues that the system is solving
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Graduate TA
- Jamie Floyd (bef2cj)
- He will be meeting with each group for a 30-minute period every other week
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	<section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# What
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Projects
- Currently, there are 8 definite projects, 8 pending projects, 10 more possible projects, and 24 others that applied that are not eligible
- So we will have a full docket of projects
- They won't be assigned until September 21st
- Each project will have a requirements document which will contain:
  - Minimum requirements
  - Desired requirements
  - Optional requirements
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# When
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Typical weekly class schedule
- Once the semester gets going, our schedule will be:
  - Mondays: a group meetings in the lecture classroom
  - Wednesdays: a lecture on a relevant topic
  - Fridays: no class!  w00t!
- However, we will be having lectures M/W/F for the first few weeks of class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings
- There are three types of meetings
- Customer meetings: where the customer and the mentor are present
  - There will be one of these every two weeks, for about 1 hour each
  - We'll go over how to handle these meetings before your first one
  - Will typically be in the first week of an iteration
- Instructor meeting: every two weeks, with the graduate TA, and for about 30 minutes each
- Group meetings: any other meeting of the group (likely 1-2 per week)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Sprints" or "Iterations"
- Work in this class will be in 2-week "sprints" or "iterations"
  - More on this in an upcoming lecture
- Tasks are chosen to be completed by the end of a given sprint
- The sprint will end on a Monday immediately prior to a customer meeting
- The customer will have a few days to look it over
- The current system can then be discussed in the customer meeting
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Phases"
- A "phase" is a period that contains 2 or 3 iterations
- Each person will be the project lead for one phase this year
  - And the secretary for a different phase
- At the end of each phase, everybody has to fill out an end-of-phase survey
  - How things went, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Attendance
- We are all adults, playing the part of professional software engineers
- Don't miss class or meetings
- I'm going to get cranky if people are always coming in late to Monday and Wednesday classes...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project deployment schedule
- Projects will not be assigned until late September
- A functional prototype consisting of the "minimum" requirements is to be deployed in December
- The final system is to be deployed by March 23rd, 2015
  - Missing this deadline will result in <strong class="red">failure for the course</strong>!
  - This gives us a month to tweak it, bug fix it, etc.
- Not delivering a working system in December (for CS 4970) or May (for CS 4971) will also result in  <strong class="red">an incomplete or failure for the course</strong>!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## High-level fall schedule
- September: learn the software framework to be used, select projects, get to know the group
- October: meet with the customer to learn the details of the project, continue to learn the software framework
- November: development of the initial system
- December: refinement of the initial system, deployment to a UVa server for the customer to start using
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Spring 2014 semester
- All of you will need to take the Spring 2014 version of this class (CS 4971)
  - All of those who are using this course as their senior thesis project will need to take it to complete their senior thesis and fulfill the capstone requirement
  - All those who are not 4th year BS CS majors have agreed to take the spring version of the course
- The spring semester is just a continuation of this course
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## High-level spring schedule
- January: fixing the bugs the customer found over the holiday break, continue software development
- February: plan for deployment, continue software development
- March: initial deployment of the revised system, continue software development
- April: deployment, beta testing by the customer, writing of the documentation
- May: Final deployment and delivery of the software to the customer
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Tracking time
- You MUST keep track of your time for this course (once projects start)
  - It will be entered via a custom system accessed through Collab -> SLP Admin, or directly through netbadge
- Not keeping track of time will incur a grade penalty!
- However, to prevent time inflation, I make this guarantee to you:
  - I will NEVER use the amount of time you enter to determine any part of your grade for this course (or the spring course)
- You are on your honor to enter time accurately

# Reports
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reports
- One of the lead responsibilities: submit reports
- The lead will need to submit three (or so) reports in each iteration
- There are two types: weekly report (one to be submitted), TPS reports (one to be submitted), and meeting reports (variable number to be submitted, but often just one)
- Recall that iterations are 2 weeks long
- Reports are submitted via Collab -> SLP Admin or log in directly via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp
  - Please don't email them to me
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Weekly Report
- This report is submitted one week into the two-week iteration, and briefly describes the progress made so far during that week
  - The customer meeting should have occurred during this time; you will have gotten feedback from that meeting
  - You will have chosen your tasks for the iteration
  - You will have (hopefully) made some development progress
- This report need not be long -- a 5-line paragraph is sufficient (say, 100 words)
  - They are judged on their quality, not quantity
- I don't like reading fluff!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The TPS Report
- TPS stands for "Termination and Post-reflection of Sprint"
  - If you do not get the reference, then you need to see the movie [Office Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space)
- This report is a bit longer than the weekly reports (say, 200 words)
- It should stand by itself (i.e., not require somebody to read another report to understand the context)
- Contents:
  - What was achieved this iteration?  It will likely have to reference github issues
  - Did you achieve all your expectations set out in the first weekly report?
  - Etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Meeting Report
- This to be submitted whenever there is a meeting with an external individual (customer or mentor)
- The purpose is to notify me of such a meeting, so I can contact them to see how things are going from their end
- It is due by the <strong class="red">end of the meeting</strong> that the report is for
  - Any team member can submit this report, and it should be done at the very end of the meeting
- Meetings without an external individual should not submit this type of report (and don't submit them when meeting with the graduate TA)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting report contents
- This report should only be **ONE LINE**
  - "Today we met with Jane Doe (customer) from 1:00-2:00 in Rice 404"
  - That's really all I want; this report is not meant to take any significant amount of time
- It should NOT go into details about what happened in that meeting
  - Those details are already in the github wiki in the meeting notes
  - And summaries would presumably go into the weekly or TPS reports
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Report due dates
- An iteration starts on a Tuesday (that is iteration day 1), and ends at the end of the day on Monday two weeks later (that is iteration day 14)
- Weekly report: due by noon on Tuesday one week into the iteration
- TPS report: due by noon on the Tuesday immediately after the iteration ends
- Meeting report: due by the end of said meeting
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rules on reports
- Don't add fluff!  I hate fluff.
- I'm interested in quality, not quantity; the word counts were just guidelines
- Reports are viewable by the entire group
  - If you have issues that require a different visibility, speak to me in person or by email
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Report submission...
- ... is YOUR responsibility
- I will always remind you in lecture, but I am not going to e-mail you to remind you
- There are grade penalties for reports not submitted or that are submitted late!
- Reports are entered into a custom system that I will show you in a week or so
  - And an e-mail is sent to me automatically when one is submitted
- Remember that the ***entire*** group gets a grade penalty if a report is not submitted, and the non-lead members can check to make sure it's submitted

# Grades
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## My grading philosophy...
- Everybody starts out with an A, and then it can only go downhill from there
- Because of this, there is no percentage of grade components
- No bell curve!  So everybody could receive an A.  Or a D.
- Delivery of a non-working system (in both December and May) will result in an incomplete or a failure for the ENTIRE group
  - I held up the graduation of 4 students in May 2013 because of this
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things that contribute to your grades
- Homework assignments
- Pop quizzes and attendance
- Customer satisfaction (based on my interactions with them as well as a survey they complete)
- Final project (in lieu of a final exam)
- Progress in achieving goals (more on this shortly)
- My evaluations of your effort and your group's effort
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things that decrement your grades
- Missing class or meetings
- Not submitting your reports (or submitting them really late)
  - I don't care if it's an hour late, but if it's a week late, that's a problem
- Not completing the surveys when requested
- Not submitting hours each iteration
- Not properly keeping track of your group progress through github issues
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things that increment your grades
- Helping the class in some way
- Higher-than-average contributions to your group
- Winning the Nobel Peace Prize
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things that do NOT affect your grade
- The number of hours you submit
  - Only whether you are regularly submitting them
- Your honest evaluations of your effort or your group members effort
- Customer evaluations
  - Customer satisfaction does affect your grade, but I take this into account with a grain of salt; the customer does not evaluate you directly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things that just make me really cranky and thus really negatively affect your grades
- Not submitting the surveys by their due date
  - This just holds up my work, and I have to go track those people down
- Not submitting the reports
  - The ***ENTIRE*** group gets a penatly for this
  - Which means that non-lead members should check to make sure the reports were submitted!
- Not submitting your hours
  - It makes it really hard to generate any statistics when people forget this
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Homeworks, pop quizzes, etc.
- There will be occasional things to be done:
  - Fill out this survey, etc.
- There will be occasional homeworks:
  - Create a website using this framework, etc.
- There may be occasional pop quizzes
- The goal of all this is to make sure everybody is doing the work necessary
  - I really hate grading
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Progress in achieving goals"
- This does not mean that you have to complete everything you initially set out to do
  - If you set out to do too much, then you will be in trouble
- It means that:
  - Your goals have to be reasonable
  - You have to make consistent progress
  - You have to keep your goals (and expectations) updated
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Exams
- None planned!
- But we will have a final project in lieu of a final exam
- And the project presentations will take place during the final exam period (Mon, Dec 15 from 9-noon)
- That being said, I reserve the write to add one if I feel like I want to spend some time grading...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Surveys
- There are 8 or 9 surveys that you will have to complete this entire year (4 or 5 a semester)
  - The beginning of fall semester survey, which includes your project preferences
  - One after each phase, which is a chance for you to say how the phase went (there are 6 or 7 of these)
  - The end of year survey in May
- All are through a system called LimeSurvey; I'll provide you with a link
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Senior Theses
- Most of you are using this as the technical project for your senior thesis
- You must still register for STS 4500!
- You will list me as your technical advisor, and you will be in a group (or project-based) senior thesis
- Those groups won't be known until late September; if this causes an issue, let me know
  - If they want your technical topic, you can let them know that you are in the CS capstone course, and that the topics will be known late September
  - If that doesn't work, I can chat with them
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## More senior theses stuff
- Your technical deliverables will be written by the group
  - As far as STS 4500/4600 goes, you just have a technical report
  - You will have other documentation to write in the spring for this course
- The technical report will have to be in ACM SIG format
  - I'll provide templates as we reach that point in the spring
- For the STS topic, you can pick something related to the nonprofit you are working with
  - Or make up your own topic
- In the initial survey you will let me know who your STS instructor is

# Legal Issues
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What software you can use
- You are NOT to reinvent the wheel!
  - If there exists software components that achieve what you want to achieve, you should use that directly!
  - You must properly cite the software that you use!
- However, we have to be cognizant of the licensing issues
  - As this is a real-world development project
- In particular, you probably can NOT use any GPL software
  - I will have an entire lecture on this...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal agreement
- There will be a legal agreement that I will ask you to sign
- It gives the nonprofit the right to:
  - Use your software forever
  - Improve upon your software
- It prevents the nonprofit from:
  - Selling or distributing your software
  - Using it for commercial purposes
- It retains for you:
  - All other rights, including the right to distribute or sell the software
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Must you sign the agreement?
- No, but if you don't, then you can not develop software for a nonprofit
  - I'll put you on some other project
- Nobody has yet objected to the agreement yet
  - Development of the agreement was in conjunction with the Provost's office and UVa's general counsel
  - In particular, it does not restrict your rights, it only gives some (limited) rights to the nonprofit
- In the survey, I will ask if you are willing to sign the agreement

# Technologies Used
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collab
- Unfortunately...
- I'll only use it for: mailing list, accout information dissemination, large file downloads
- And not much else...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## github.com
- The main course repo will be there, including all the slide notes
  - https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp
- You will need to provide two private repositories for the git/github homework
- Your individual project repositories will be hosted there
  - They will be private, and will be provided to you for free
- We'll be using issues and the wiki extensively
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Continuous Integration (CI) site
- I haven't determined which one yet, though
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Mediawiki
- This is the wiki that Wikipedia uses
- A bunch of tutorials are there, and the project-in-lieu-of-the-final-exam will likely be entered here
  - Although this may move to github...

## CakePHP
- This is a framework written for the PHP language
- Pros:
  - PHP is an easy language to learn
  - Relatively easy to install
  - We have almost 80 tutorials on how to do things in CakePHP
- Cons:
  - There are a bunch of odd things that it does (such as using lots of memory, a start-up cost to each URL access) that tend to drive people crazy

## Ruby on Rails
- Ruby is the language, Rails is the framework
- Pros:
  - Ruby and Rails interoperate much better than CakePHP
  - It's a "cleaner" OO experience than CakePHP
  - There are a LOT of libraries ("gems") available
- Cons:
  - Installation is a real pain in the @#($&#.
  - Most hosting sites have very old (and likely very insecure) versions installed
    - And you can't run multiple versions on a single web server instance
  - We have no tutorials for Ruby, but less institutional knowledge of it
  - This, you will be more "on your own" with Ruby

## Django
- A python-based MVC (model-view-controller) development environment
- I am considering this as a platform possibility
- Pros:
  - Python is a really nice language to develop in
  - There are a lot of nice libraries available
- Cons:
  - It is harder (but not impossible) to find hosting providers
  - There is even less institutional knowledge of Django than Ruby on Rails

## Front-end design frameworks
- In the spring, the use of a design framework for the front-end parts will be required
