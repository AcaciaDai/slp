	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- Fall semester: 6 iterations
  - Each phase will be two iterations long
  - Phase 1 is iterations 1-2, phase 2 is iterations 3-4, and phase 3 is iterations 5-6
- Spring semester: 8 iterations
  - Phase sizes will differ depending on the group size
  - For 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases
    - Phase 4 is iterations 7-9, phase 5 is iterations 10-11, and phase 6 is iterations 12-14
  - For 7 person groups, there will be 4 phases
    - Phase 4 is iterations 7-8, phase 5 is iterations 9-10, phase "5.5" is iterations 11-12, and phase 6 is iterations 13-14
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project leadership roles
- Everybody will be lead for one phase and secretary for another
- Nobody can have two leadership roles in the fall
  - Thus, 7 person groups will have one person that has both roles in the spring
- You must decide today who is the lead and secretary for the entire year
  - You can change this later, subject to the same restrictions, by emailing me
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pick a project leads
- How you pick is up to you
- If you can't decide, then I propose the following:
  - Sort everybody by (formal) first names in *reverse* order, and that is the order of the leads
  - The 4th person in that list is the first secretary, and it cycles through
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pick a secretary
- This is the person who will take notes at each meeting
- Each meeting MUST have notes!
  - This is how I am going to be able to keep up with all the projects
- They should be entered into the Github wiki
  - We are all CS majors, and we can all create wiki sub-pages
- The secretary will rotate through everybody, just like the project lead
  - And the secretary can not be the project lead in the same iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remember to report time
- Keep track of ALL time you expend for this course
  - Meetings (customer and not), learning CakePHP, etc.
- The only things you should NOT include are Monday's group meetings and Wednesday's lecture
- This is to be reported via the custom app that I will show you on Wednesday
  - Recall that you grade will NEVER depend (one way or the other) on how much time you report
  - But there WILL be a grade penalty if you do enter an amount of time
  - You can report 0 hours (you really shouldn't, by the way) to avoid the grade penalty
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scheduling the first meeting
- You should contact the customer listed in the requirements document
  - <font color="red">But not before I give the go-ahead, as I want to talk to them first!</font>
  - I expect that to be later today or early tomorrow.
- Then try to arrange an initial meeting as best as possible
  - The scheduling of the meetings will be tricky, and we're going to talk about it a bit today
- Remember to take notes!
- You may not be able to meet this week, due to scheduling issues
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuff on my todo list...
- At some point today you will receive from me:
  - A e-mail from me that is the go-ahead to contact the customer
  - Updated pegasus account information (in particular, the group account information)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
- Fully understand the requirements
  - Generate questions to ask!
- Meet with the customer
  - As the questions that you generated!
- Design a basic DB schema
  - And enter it into your pegasus group DB, or generate the forms via Rails or Django
  - Get a basic MVC website working (CRUD operations for the schema tables)
  - This should be on pegasus
- Have this all entered into git/github
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues
  - We'll talk about this in an upcoming class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Nametags
- I am going to give each group a set of "Hello, my name is..." nametags
  - Do *not* fill in "Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
- And a Sharpie marker for each group
  - They are too hard to read when written in pen or pencil
- You are to use these in each of the customer meetings until you run out
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## For the rest of today's lecture
- Split off into groups
  - Select leads and a secretaries for the year
  - Fill out the [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../../uva/project-start-info-sheet.pdf), and turn that in before you leave
- Look over the requirements documents
- Generate a list of questions and clarifications that you want to get from the customer
  - The secretary should take notes!
