## Monday, September 8th, 2014
- The [second homework (frameworks)](../../docs/hw-frameworks.html), is out
  - The CakePHP part is due by Wed, 9/10, by the end of the day
  - The Ruby on Rails part is due by Mon, 9/15, by the end of the day
  - The Django part is due by Fri, 9/19, by the end of the day
  - All parts of the assignment are ready!
- Late policy: there is none.  Late homeworks receive zero credit.
- My office hours have changed: 2:00-3:30 M/W, although they will be 12:00-1:30 M/W this week
- *Some* of the project descriptions are out
  - Clone the `uva-slp/projects` repo; you should all have read access
  - These are not for public dissemination!
  - There are 13 known projects, and 2 more that are being generated (although only 10 of the requirements documents are in the repo)
- We have a [VirtualBox Linux image](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/54bcbf62-81cb-45bc-bf8c-c7d46467bba5/kubuntu-14.04.1.vdi.zip) for you to use; installation instructions can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html); details about the image can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/vb-image-details.html)
  - Be aware that VirtualBox 4.3.14 (the current version) does not work well on Windows if you have anti-virus software installed; consider installing 4.3.12 instead
- Today we will finish [03: Legal issues](03-legal.html), and start on [04: Frameworks](04-frameworks.html)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Homework 2 (and 3 and 4)
- It's in the repo, on the [docs page](../../docs/index.html) ([md](../../docs/index.md)), along with a lot of relevant documentation
- Basically, it's to build a basic MVC site in each of three frameworks: CakePHP, Ruby, and Django
  - There are specific tutorials to follow; you can't just create anything
  - The URLs for your sites must be EXACTLY correct
- A few notes:
  - We are using the 3.0 CakePHP API, although it is still in beta right now
  - The [CakePHP: getting started](../../docs/cakephp-getting-started.html) ([md](../../docs/cakephp-getting-started.md)) page lists three more commands you need to run to get your VirtualBox image ready
- All parts are ready!
- The server is pegasus.cs.virginia.edu, and you can view your page at http://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu/~mst3k
  - Your login credentials are in the PostEm tool in Collab
  - ssh RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
  - ssh ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
- Make sure the URLs match!  You can find them listed at the end of the homework page

## GPL in the news
- [DMCA Claim Over Non-Compliance Shuts Off Minecraft Plug-Ins](http://games.slashdot.org/story/14/09/06/1323225/dmca-claim-over-gpl-non-compliance-shuts-off-minecraft-plug-ins)
- Basically, a developer wrote 23k lines of GPL'ed code which allows Minecraft plug-ins...
  - And this code is not allowed to be used in commercial applications unless they release the code...
  - And since they are not releasing the code, this has to be resolved before development continues...
  - And it may shut down Minecraft plugins until the framework can be re-written

- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Window to run WAMP...
- How many of all y'all know C#?
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ker2iMrVsEqfE_lmsb850Sq2vyLZ0NNWlFjmf5LXRHw/viewform) by the end of the day tomorrow (Tuesday).

<h2>Friday, August 29th, 2014</h2>
<img class="stretch" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/writing_skills.png" title="I&#39;d like to find a corpus of writing writing from children in a non-self-selected sample (e.g. handwritten letters to the president from everyone in the same teacher&#39;s 7th grade class every year)--and score the kids today versus the kids 20 years ago on various objective measures of writing quality. I&#39;ve heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I&#39;d bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day." alt="Writing Skills" />
