## Wednesday, October 15th, 2014
- We are in the second week of iteration 2
- Customer meetings: don't forget to submit the meeting report when you have met with them!
  - And don't forget to wear your name tags!
- Leads: your weekly reports were due yesterday by noon
  - Everybody got them in, albeit some were late
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](01-intro.html), specifically [here](01-intro.html#/6/3)
- Don't forget to report your hours!!!
  - This is a course requirement -- not completing them will result in a failure for the course
- Grades for the first three homeworks have been returned
  - You can submit regrades (through the end of this week) via the course management system
when they were returned (Sep 29)
- As there was no group meeting day on Monday, we'll have one today
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration 2
- You should pick 24 or 28 story points worth of "stuff" to do; pick the highest priority stuff!
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and Jamie should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes (see the [wireframing lecture](09-wireframing.html) and consider using [jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com))
  - Set up everybody's development environment (see the [development environment setup](../../docs/dev-env-setup.html) ([md](../../docs/dev-env-setup.md)) page)
    - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys (see 
    - Enable easy downloading of the database
    - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Requirements document
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you, but I need to be able to view it
  - Having the original source (in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) in a `docs` directory in your repo is quite reasonable

- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and Jamie should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's today's lecture; this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work

## Monday, October 6th, 2014
- We are on the last day of iteration 1
- Customer meetings: don't forget to submit the meeting report when you have met with them!
  - And don't forget to wear your name tags!
- Leads: your TPS reports were due tomorrow by noon
  - The reporting system is through netbadge via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/
  - Remember that the *entire* group gets a penalty if the report is not submitted!
  - Everybody can view the submitted reports through the [reporting system](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/)
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](01-intro.html), specifically [here](01-intro.html#/6/3)
- Don't forget to report your hours!!!
- Account information (git and pegasus), as well as framework setup (including Django) can be found in the [daily announcements from Mon, 9/29](#setup)
  - If you are running into deployment issues, don't wait until the last minute to get them resolved!
- My office hours are back to being 2:00-3:30 M/W
- Grades for the git HW and the cake HW have been returned; any concerns should be addressed within 2 weeks of today
- Today is a group work day; Wednesday is a lecture on wireframing
- If we still need them, then I have the [meeting locations](../../../../work/slp/groups/meeting-locations.html)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A few clarifications
- Issues in github should be development-related, not meeting-related
- Your landing page on your project's URL should point to the various CRUD pages (and put in a reasonable title, etc.)
  - Remember that this is what you are going to demo to the customer!
- Your database schema should be called schema.sql (or schema.py, or schema.rb, etc.), and should be in the root directory of your repo, so that we can find it
- Having deployment issues?  I can help, but not at the last minute...

## Goals for iteration 1
- This is duplicated from the [06: project start](06-project-start.html) slide set (specifically, [here](06-project-start.html#/goals))
- Fully understand the requirements
  - Generate questions to ask the customer!
  - This may mean that the requirements document is updated or changed; the original source version is in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects)
- Meet with the customer
  - As the questions that you generated!
- Design a basic DB schema
  - And enter it into your pegasus group DB, or generate the forms via Rails or Django
  - So that we can find it, commit it as schema.sql or db/schema.sql
- Get a basic MVC website working (CRUD operations for the schema tables)
  - This should all be working on pegasus by the end of the iteration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo
  - You are all members of your respective repos
  - I will give directions for initalizing the repo later this week
  - ***PASSWORDS ARE NOT TO BE STORED IN THE REPO***
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues
  - This is described in the [estimation](08-estimation.html) slide set

## Monday, September 29th, 2014
- We are one week into iteration 1

  - Don't forget to submit the meeting report when you have met with them!
  - If you met last week, and didn't submit it, then please do so during class today
  - And don't forget to wear your name tags!
- Leads: your first weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon
  - Details can be found in the [course introduction slide set](01-intro.html), specifically [here](01-intro.html#/6/2)

## Reporting System
- Two ways to access it
  - Via the "Reporting" tool in Collab
  - Through netbadge via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/slp/ (netbadge *should* work, but only on https, not http)
    - (please use that URL -- even though it's a redirect, the final URL will be changing soon, but that redirect will still point to the right one)
- This is how you submit your reports for this course
- Features
  - Submit, view, and edit reports
  - Submit, view, and edit hours worked
  - View attendance, evaluations, grades, leadership iterations, and project members
- We'll see a tour of it today
	  </script></section>

## Project accounts, git, etc.
- How to initalize the repo with git...
  - You *should* add a readme.md file (and fill it in appropriately)
- I need to know, soonish, the platform choice of that one last group...
- Properly configured URLs (here 'project' is your project tag):
  - CakePHP: put the files in project@server:~/html; the URL will be http://server/~project/ (no configuration from me needed); in all cases, http://server/project redirects to http://server/~project
  - Ruby: the files will go in ~/project (aka ~project/project), and the URL will be http://server/project; this is alrady configured on the web server
  - Django: it's all working!  Directions on the next slide; the URL will be http://server/project
- The server account info on PostEm has been updated with the group account info

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Django instructions
- Create the django project:
```
django-admin startproject project
```
  - And set up the DB, etc.
- Create the Django app:
```
django manage.py startapp app
```
  - This implies that the static directory is: app/static/app/
- Set the Django app's URLs, as described in the "Setting the static directory" section of the [Django getting started](../../docs/django-getting-started.html) ([md](../../docs/django-getting-started.md)) page
- Change the location of the static directory in settings.py, as described on that same page in the "Setting the static directory" section
  - This may require different settings.py on the local machine and on the server
- Upload those files to the project accout, and then (as the project user), run:
```
wsgi-admin -register <wsgi.py> -app app -root
```
- At this point, your project should be available at http://server/project

## Wednesday, September 24th, 2014
- Projects have started!
  - Contacting the customer: I emailed them (very early) this morning, so you can contact them about arranging an initial meeting
- We will see the system for entering time and reports likely next Monday (there will probably not be enough time today)
  - The first report is not due until next Tuesday
  - This means you will have to keep track of your time separately until then
  - This system will also hold your homework grades, iteration evaluations, etc.
- github stuff
  - Issues and wiki have been enabled in all the repos
  - We will go over entering issues next Wednesday
  - I do not "watch" the repos, so to get my attention, you need to tag me ("@aaronbloomfield")
  - This is ***NOT*** how you ask me to do something!
- My office hours are back to being 2:00-3:30 M/W

## Project Descriptions

See the https://github.com/uva-slp/projects repository (you all have access).

Specifically, see the [2014/readme.md](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2014/readme.md) file.  Let's chat about the projects...

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The survey
- You will shortly receive an email to participate
- You really do have to read through *each* of the requirements documents
  - You don't have to memorize every detail; you can skim some of the finer details here
  - But for your top choice projects, you really do need to read through the entire thing
- A listing of the survey questions is in the [uva-slp/projects](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repository
  - In [2014/survey](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/tree/master/2014/survey)
  - There are four parts, which we'll go over today

- Basically, a developer wrote 23k lines of GPL'ed code which allows Minecraft plug-ins...
  - And this code is not allowed to be used in commercial applications unless they release the code...
  - And since they are not releasing the code, this has to be resolved before development continues...
  - And it may shut down Minecraft plugins until the framework can be re-written

- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Window to run WAMP...
- How many of all y'all know C#?
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ker2iMrVsEqfE_lmsb850Sq2vyLZ0NNWlFjmf5LXRHw/viewform) by the end of the day tomorrow (Tuesday).

I&#39;ve heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I&#39;d bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day." alt="Writing Skills" />

## Friday, August 29th, 2014
- The [first homework, on git and github](../../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due next Friday by 10 a.m.
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `floydbe` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment
- There will be two more homeworks each successive week, then we start the projects
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image set up for you to use for this course, with all the software installed
  - The image is on Collab ([direct link](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/54bcbf62-81cb-45bc-bf8c-c7d46467bba5/kubuntu-14.04.1.vdi.zip)); installation instructions can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html); details about the image can be found [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/vb-image-details.html)
  - Be aware that VirtualBox 4.3.14 (the current version) does not work well if you have anti-virus software installed; consider installing 4.3.12 instead
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Window to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the [github userid survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ker2iMrVsEqfE_lmsb850Sq2vyLZ0NNWlFjmf5LXRHw/viewform) by early next week!  Say, by the end of Tuesday.
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the proejct information to you
