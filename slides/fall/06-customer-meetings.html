# Introduction

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ah Meetings...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ah Meetings...
- Studies of software developers have shown that nearly 60% of your time as a developer is working with another person
  - 28% working with just one other person
  - 30% working with two or more people
- Programming is NOT a solo activity!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings of All Flavors
- Meetings come in all different forms
- They change based on where you currently are in the project
- Early in the project (Inception Phase)
  - Pitch meeting
  - Vision meeting
  - Contract negotiation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings of All Flavors
- Starting the project
  - Requirements elicitation and modeling
  - Initial customer meetings
- End of the project
  - Post-mortem
  - Customer wrap-up
 - Maintenance planning
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuck in the middle with you
- During the course of the project are the regular meetings that drive how a project progresses
- These are called different things in each process
  - Daily Meeting
  - Stand-Up Meeting
  - Scrum Meeting
  - Iteration Meeting
- In the end, these all drive the iterative process
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scrum Iterations
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How do we differ?
- This is not your full time job
- You do not have an office to go to
- You do not have a clock to punch (i.e. you do your work at odd hours)
- You are not being paid (sort of...)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How does this affect your meetings?
- Well, what do you think?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How does this affect your meetings?
- Frequency
- Timing (ideally, held at same time/place)
- Accountability
- Routine (set questions to answer usually)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What makes a bad meeting?
- We’ve all been in them... what do you think?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is should not affect
- Meetings with the customer need to "follow the rules"
- Even if your process is a little off, customers are still customers!
- If anything, we need to show that we’re on top of what we’re working on!

# Driving a Customer Meeting
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Customers are fickle creatures
  - Some will want to drive the meeting
  - Some will want you to drive
  - Some will wait for any requests for comments
  - Some will offer comments so readily you won’t get a word in
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #1: Do not wing it!
  - These are people "paying" you
  - You should have a well thought out demo / presentation ready to go
  - You should have specific questions planned out
  - You should have these items prioritized so you get through the high-value items first
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #2: Ask their opinion!
  - Some customers will give you their thoughts no matter what
  - Others, you need to draw it out
  - The trick is to get them to comment specifically on things and not to give general answers
  - Try to draw them into talking about a specific feature or question
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #3: Incomplete work can’t be demoed
  - Focus on your successes from the past iteration
  - Don’t hide the fact that you didn’t complete something
  - But also don’t put it in their face that you didn’t complete something!
  - Keep the meeting on a positive note
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #4: Set priorities for the next iteration
  - Based on what you show off this week, derive what are the next most important features that should be worked on during the coming iteration
  - Remember: the customer chooses with your input, not the other way around!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #5: Be professional
  - Act professional – watch your jokes, appropriate language, etc.
  - Dress properly – we aren’t talking a suit here, but maybe comb your hair and put on a clean shirt
    - (okay, we can go a bit beyond this)
  - Don’t ask inappropriate questions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #6: Understand the mentor’s role
  - S/he is there to offer advice
    - This may be occasional guidance, or it may be a full walk-through of something
  - S/he is NOT there to code
    - In fact, for legal reasons, the mentor can NEVER contribute code
  - Realize that s/he is a volunteer who is doing this out of an interest to help the community
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting Planning
- Develop an agenda
- Plan out your demo
- Come up with questions
- Come up with ideas on what will be in the next iteration
- Decide what is a reasonable workload in the next iteration
	  </script></section>

# Legal Issues
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rules
- The three rules that follow have been created in conjunction with Rick Schupp, the directory of UVa‘s office of Risk Management
  - They are not a judgment of your capabilities as an adult
  - Nor is it a judgment of the mentor/customer
  - It is simply a set of guidelines to keep you safe
- And to address a UVa liability issue
- Because you are being ‘assigned’ to a mentor and a customer, UVa (and me!) wants to make sure that you are not forced into a uncomfortable situation as a result of this assignment
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 1
- You are NEVER to be in a meeting with a customer or a mentor just by yourself – you must be in a group of at least 2 student group members
  - Typically the meetings with mentors will be with the full group
  - But if you go to the customer’s site, you MUST have another group member along with you
  - No exceptions!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 2
- You are NEVER to be in a situation where the mentor or customer gives you a ride home
  - If you do not have transportation, then either make them come to you, or don’t have the meeting that week
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 3
- If anything in a meeting feels wrong, or makes you feel uncomfortable, you should leave immediately and let me know ASAP
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Notification
- The customers and mentors will all be made aware of these rules
- If it ever comes up, please let them know that I have insisted on this
  - You SHOULD defer the blame to me
- Feel free to chat with me about any of these issues (or any of your customer / mentor interactions)
