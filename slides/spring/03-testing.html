# Introduction
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing is not absolute!
- You can never prove that a (non-trivial) program is bug free
  - It's the [halting problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem): prove that a program halts (successfully) on a given input
  - Alan Turing proved that this was *undecidable* (meaning an algorithm cannot be constructed that could decide this)
- It's very easy to prove that a bug exists, though...
- But you can give yourself -- and your customer -- some sense of confidence that it will likely work correctly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Bug rate
- A 1990 review estimated that there were 1 to 3 bugs per 100 executable statements
  - Actually, programmers make many more (1.5 bugs per executable statement!), but they will catch 99% of those
- Your job is to catch the other 1%
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Costs of transition
- A much older study indicated that transition and maintenance takes 67% of the cost of a project
  - And that doesn't include an additional 15% of testing during development!
  - Granted, that was during the waterfall methodology craze...
- You are finished with this class when the semester ends
  - If you want to help debug it later on, that's great -- but there is no requirement nor expectation for you to do so
- So we need to ensure that it is well tested before the semester concludes
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things to keep in mind...
- We can *NOT* rely on the customer to complete tests!
- There will be *NO* new code features developed during iterations 12-14
  - Only test cases, bug fixes, minor feature changes requested by the customer, etc.
- Your test plan must be significant, and must go beyond what is described here
  - You can start [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Software_Testing)
  - If you wait until the last minute, then throw something half-baked together, I am going to get very cranky
	  </script></section>

# Requirements
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why requirements?
- We can't have a discussion about testing without having some set of requirements to test against
- Requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional
- Software attributes are described by the acronym FURPS
  - Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Functional & non-functional requirements
- Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do ("system shall *do* X")
  - Given an input, what is the desired outcome / output?
- Non-functional define how a system is supposed to be ("system shall *be* X")
  - Rather than specific behaviors, it is criteria used to judge a system
- Functional requirements are defined in the system design; non-functional in the system architecture
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Types of requirements
- Requirements are usually described by the FURPS acronym
  - F: Funcionality
  - U: Usability
  - R: Reliability
  - P: Performance
  - S: Stability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Furps: Functionality
- Feature set
- Capabilities
- Generality
- Security
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## fUrps: Usability
- Human factors
- Aesthetics
- Consistency
- Documentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## fuRps: Reliability
- Frequency/severity of failure
- Recoverability
- Predictability
- Accuracy
- Mean time to failure
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## furPs: Performance
- Speed
- Efficiency
- Resource consumption
- Throughput
- Response time
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## furpS: Supportability
- Testability
- Extensibility
- Adaptability
- Maintainability
- Compatibility
- Configurability
- Serviceability
- Installability
- Localizability
- Portability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirements document
- Creating the test plan assumes that you have an updated requirements document
- If there are no requirements (or the requirements are unknown), then there is no point in testing!
	  </script></section>

# Softawre Defects
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a software "bug"?
- ... when the system crashes
- ... when the system has undesirable results
- ... when the system does not handle border cases
- ... when the system has invalid output
- ... when the system has calculation errors
- ... when the system has control flow errors
- ... when the system has race conditions
- ... when the system has errors interpreting data
- More [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Common_types_of_computer_bugs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a software "defect"?
- Certainly any software bug
- When the software system does not conform to the requirement specification
  - This assumes that the specification exists and is correct!
- Usability problems: too difficult to navigate, etc.
- Missing commands
  - If it's not in the specification, then it's a specification error as well
- Performance issues
- Licensing issues!
  - This is particularly relevant to us
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section id="terminology" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Terminology
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology
- Black box testing: internal design is not considered, only external design
- White box testing: testing is based on detailed knowledge of how the code works
- Regression testing: testing the entire system after a modification has been made
- Acceptance testing: running the tests to make sure the system is in an 'acceptable' state (i.e., has passed all the tests)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Alpha versus beta testing
- Alpha testing: done at the end of development to make sure the system works
  - This is what you will be doing during development but BEFORE the end of iteration 11 (i.e., March 24)
- Beta testing: an initial version is deployed, and tested "in-place" by the team, the customer, and possibly others
  - This is what will happen in iterations 12-14
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	<section>

	  <section id="specific" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Specific Test Types
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "On the fly" testing
- Try to do a bunch of things, and see if it doesn't work right
  - This is the typical testing done on may types of projects (undergraduate course projects, short pieces of software, etc.)
- Good as an initial start, but this does not provide very good coverage...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System or requirements testing
- Does the system handle the specified requirements?
- Go through each user case / user story, and see if all the parts are included as system functionality
  - If not, then either the system has to be modified or the use case / user story needs to be updated
- Treat the system as a black box
- Once the user manual is written, you will need to ensure that it conforms to the usage of the system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unit testing
- A set of tests of each individual "unit"
  - Method, procedure, class, etc.
- We have a tutorial on PHPUnit testing, which is a good place to start
  - Both CakePHP and Rails have a lot of support for unit testing
- The unit testing will need to cover ALL the aspects of the system
- There will be a significant amount of code for this!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installation testing, part 1
- One of the documentation artifacts that you must produce is an installation document
- Once done, you need to ensure that it works
- Given a standard Linux machine...
  - The CS 2150 image, which does NOT have apache installed
- ... does the installation document properly describe now to configure and install the system?
  - You can assume a package manager such as apt-get
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installation testing, part 2
- Don't forget things such as:
  - Enabling URL rewriting for CakePHP
  - Installing all the Rails gems
  - Permissioning directories
  - Database installation and setup
- Note, from the [Deliverables slide set](02-deliverables.html) that the amount of detail you put in about the packages to install should be limited
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Usability testing
- Most of these systems are intended to be used by specific, trained, individuals
  - But not all!
- So while we don't need a perfect UI, it should still be relatively easy to use
- Can the user understand the application flow?  Are the editing functions easy to use?  Is there sufficient help documentation available (likely in the user manual)?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Security testing
- Much of the information in these sites is protected under federal law!
- Can the system be hacked?  Penetrated?  Which pages can be accessed without credentials?
- How does the system handle authorization versus authentication?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malformed input testing
- How well does the system handle malformed input?
  - For *each* type of input, what happens if the input is invalid?
- Likewise, how well does the system handle incorrect URLs?
  - CakePHP can set the various 'debug' option in core.php to control how this is handled
  - Rails can do something similar
  - But you may need to add a 404 page as well
- This may be included in the unit testing (for malformed input) or system testing (for malformed URLs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing we likely won't be doing...
- Compatibility testing: our system is only going to run on one type of configuration
- Load, stress, and performance testing: one or two groups may need this, but most won't
- Recovery testing: our system is not the type that can "crash" very often
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What about other test types?
- If your system requires other types of tests, then you should definitely include them!
	  </script></section>

# Master Test Plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Master test plan
- Due at the end of iteration 8 (February 10th)
- This is a high-level overview of the testing
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## IEEE standard
- [IEEE 829 (2008): Standard for Software and System Test Documentation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4578383)
  - Free if viewed from UVa; it's also in Collab as [Resourfces/misc/IEEE-829-2008.pdf](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/34417471-f045-46f1-a50f-738fa387fa54/misc/IEEE-829-2008.pdf)
  - And on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_829)
- Section 8 concerns the Master Test Plan ("MTP" in the document)
- Some of it is fluff-inducing, so we'll take it with a grain of salt
  - Basically, if something doesn't apply, then state so rather than make something up
  - The listing there is meant to provide a structure, not cause you to BS your way through the test plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Relevant parts of the IEEE standard
- Some sections are where the real content is going
  - Section 8.1.5.6: tools, techniques, methods, and metrics
  - Section 8.2.1: Test processes including definition of test levels
    - (well, less on the test levels...)
- That being said, the following slides are things that should go somewhere in the test plan...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What *parts* of the system will be tested?
- Probably not all the code of the gems (for Rails) or plugins (for CakePHP) that you are using
  - But likely your code to interact with them
  - And certainly their functionality
- And likely not the code that was automatically generated (bake in CakePHP, for example)
- So saying "everything else" is missing the point
  - List the specific methods and functionality that are going to be tested
  - You can certainly use wildcards, etc., for this
- You have MVC components, and you will need to test all those parts
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Who will write the tests?
- Is it going to be all one person?  (this is a BAD idea!)
- Will it be a small group within the overall group?
- Will it be everybody?
- If more than one person, who will write the tests for what?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What will you write the tests in?
- CakePHP and Rails has good support for unit testing
  - This means you will need to become familiar with the unit testing platform you are using!
- My plan is to use [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) for the continuous integration testing
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How will you determine what cases to test?
- Corner cases, malformed input cases, first to perform an action, scheduling in a full calendar, etc.
- This will require creating lots of *fixtures*, which are the sample data in the DB when the unit test is run
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How will you determine what tests to write?
- There are a lot of sites online for "how to test a X", where 'X' is a various part of your system
  - Model, View, Controller, etc.
- See starting [here](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/testing.html#testing-models) for CakePHP, and starting [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#functional-tests-for-your-controllers) for Rails
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How will you ensure that your test covers your code?
- CakePHP can use [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/)
- The Rails standard seems to be [Rconv](https://github.com/relevance/rcov) for older versions of Ruby, and [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) for Ruby 1.9+
- Or Google for "code coverage rails" or "code coverage cakephp"
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How will you indicate what is being tested
- From the point of view of the tests, you will need to indicate what requirement is being tested
  - This can be a one-line comment in the unit test
- From the point of view of the requirements, what tests are validating that those requirements work?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What *other* types of tests (other than unit tests) will you be performing?
- Hint: look at the [previous section](#/specific) for details
  - This includes, among other things: installation testing, usability testing, security testing, FURPS, etc.
- You will need to give an overview (following the concepts discussed in the previous few slides) for these tests as well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## References
- The page on CakePHP testing is [here](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/testing.html), and pretty much contains everything you will need
  - Well, and the page on [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/)
  - And [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) for code coverage
- Rails can start [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html), which contains almost everything you need
  - Although you will likey want to get more info on [Rconv](https://github.com/relevance/rcov) or [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) for the code coverage
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remember!
- If something the IEEE docuemnt doesn't make sense, or is confusing, or seems to be in another language, you can ignore it
- That document is meant to provide *structure*, not to force you to create a lot of fluff
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Todo
- the next two slides were separate previously, but should be merged into the master test plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 1
- Due at the end of iteration 10 (March 10th)
- You need to start planning what specific tests you are going to perform
- The overview of those tests is in the master test plan
- So now fill in the details:
  - What unit tests are you going to use?  What is your plan for determining which ones to write?  How are yhou going to write them?
  - Describe the installation test in more detail
  - Describe the requirements tests that will be performed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 2
- Whereas the master test plan is a high level overview
- The specific test plans add in the low level details
- Combined, the two should describe exactly how you are going to test the system
	  </script></section>

# Continuous Integration Testing
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Jenkins
- We'll be using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) ([Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_%28software%29)) for our continuous integration testing
- To get started, visit [http://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu:8080/](http://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu:8080/)
  - If you install it locally, it will use http://localhost:8080
  - And all the information is stored in ~/.jenkins/
- A tutorial can be found [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Use+Jenkins)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How we will use Jenkins
- The group will write unit tests
- Jenkins will be configured to run those unit tests on each "build" (git push or svn commit)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unit tests with CakePHP
- See [here](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/testing.html) for all the gory details
- CakePHP supports PHPUnit, which needs to be installed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unit tests with Rails

	  <section id="codecoverage" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Code Coverage
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## To talk about
- include code coverage tools and analysis
- problems with code coverage reports: https://wiki.python.org/moin/CodeCoverage
- the master test plan needs to include what was in the specific test plans
- in addition to travis/circle, they should be able to run unit tests on the course server
- they can use other tools, if they check with me first; these are just some suggestions
  - specify what the requirements for those other tools are (what needs to be shown, etc.)
- examples online, but need to get the groups' permission before displaying them...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Problems with code coverage
Consider the following pseudo-code:
```
if ( foo() && bar() && baz() ) {
  // do something...
}
```
- If `foo()` returns false, then by [short circuit evaluation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation), `bar()` and `baz()` will not be evaluated
  - PHP, Ruby, and Python all perform short-circuit evaluation (as do most programming languages)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Python / Django instructions
- The assumption is that `python manage.py test` works
- Install [coverage.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage): `sudo apt-get install python-coverage`
  - The binary is `python-coverage`, not `coverage.py`
- The tests must be run prior to generating the reports:
```
python-coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
```
- Commands generate the report:
```
python-coverage report
python-coverage report -m
python-coverage html
```
  - The first is a text-based report; the second has line numbers; the third is an HTML-based report (in a htmlcov/ sub-directory)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## PHP / CakePHP instructions
- The assumption is that `phpunit` works
- No additional installs necessary
- The tests are run *while* generating the reports, not before
- Commands to generate the report:
```
phpunit --coverage-text
phpunit --coverage-text=file.txt
phpunit --coverage-html webroot/coverage
```
  - The first generates a text-based report to standard output; the second generates a text-based report to `file.txt`; the third creates an HTML-based report in the `webroot/coverage` sub-directory
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ruby / Rails
- The assumeption is that `bundle exec rake test` works
- Installation (instructions are duplicated from [here](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov#getting-started))
  - Install the [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) gem: put in the following into the Gemfile, then run `bundle install --path=vendor/bundle`
```
gem 'simplecov', :require => false, :group => :test
```
  - Add a few lines to the top of `test/test_helper.rb`:
```
if ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'test'
      require 'simplecov'
      SimpleCov.start 'rails'
      puts "required simplecov"
end
```
- When you run `bundle exec rake test`, it will generate the HTML report in the `coverage/` sub-directory

## Using other tools
- The tools listed here were chosen because they can run on the course server and on your VirtualBox image
- You are welcome to use different code coverage tools, with the following requirements:
  - It needs to generate the same type of data (percent covered, lines not covered, etc.)
  - You need to check with me first

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Acceptance testing
- This is a test (or multiple tests) performed to ensure that the system meets customer specifications
- For our purposes, the 'acceptance test' will be the successful execution of the test plan

## Iteration deliverables
- All of these are due on the last day (a Monday) of each iteration
- Iteration 7: deployment plan (due Jan 27)
- Iteration 8: master test plan (due Feb 10)
- Iteration 9: continuous integration test plan (due Feb 24)
- Iteration 10: specific test plan(s) (due Mar 10)
- Iteration 11: the full transition plan, encompassing all of the above, all edited into one document (due Mar 24)

## Test plan standard
- [IEEE 829 (2008): Standard for Software and System Test Documentation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4578383)
  - Free if viewed from UVa; it's also in Collab under misc/ as well
  - And on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_829)
- We will be following *SOME THINGS* of this standard
  - The full standard is way too bloated and just encourages fluff
  - This is intended to give you a structure, not to restrict what you do...

## I don't want fluff!
- If you add verbiage for the sake of adding verbiage, I'll just get really cranky
  - It's a waste of everybody's time
  - If a section doesn't apply just put a single sentence that this doesn't apply (and perhaps why not)
- That being said, I want a well thought-out master test plan
  - So you are going to have to actually read through some of that standard, various Wikipedia pages, etc.
  - You can start at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Software_Testing)

## Test plan contents: the tests
- A list (and brief description) of the specific test types that you plan on performing
  - What requirement each test (or test type) is validating
  - How you plan on doing those tests.  Some examples:
    - Requirements testing may mean that you go through each of the requirements (which must be linked!) to ensure that they match
    - Security testing will require a specific set of "hacks" against the system, such as X, Y, and Z
    - Unit tests: what parts of the system are you testing?  With which unit tests?  How will you determine which unit tests to write?
- The point of this part is to think of the testing plan from the point of view of the tests that are going to be performed

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Test plan contents: the stuff to be tested
- A list (and brief description) of the specific things that you are trying to test, and which test(s) will be testing those
  - Examples: requirements, security, installation, etc.
- The "which test(s) will be testing those" part can just be a cross-reference into the material from the previous slide
- The point of this part is to think of the testing plan from the point of view of what needs to be tested
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What should NOT be in the test plan (yet)
- The specific unit tests that you are going to be performing
  - You should give overall ideas, but the specific unit tests will be detailed later
- Full details about specific tests
  - Example: the "installation test" can be a short paragraph stating that the tester(s) will follow the installation manual from an unconfigured machine
    - Since there is no installation manual yet, there is no need to go into more detail at this point

## Iteration deliverables format
- I don't really care what format you keep it in
- Keeping it as a wiki page in Redmine is fine (and the preferable way)
- You can also do this as a Google doc, a Word doc, etc.
- If it is an online document (wiki page, Google doc, etc.), you will have to e-mail me when it is done
  - And ensure that I have access (if it's not in Redmine)
  - If it's not Redmine, then the Redmine wiki should have a link to it
- If it's a offline document (Word, OpenOffice, etc.), then you will have to upload it to Remdine
  - And again e-mail me when it's there
- Eventually it will need to be exported to a PDF

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## End-of-semester testing requirements
- There will be some (relatively minor) end-of-semester testing requirements so that each system's tests operate the same way
- Examples: a test plan document in a common .pdf file name; 'make test' to kick off the tests; following the CakePHP procedure for unit tests, etc.
  - Details about this to be decided later...
- These aren't meant to be onerous, but to ensure that all the systems have some level of consistency
