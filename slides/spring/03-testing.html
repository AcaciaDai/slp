# Introduction
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing is not absolute!
- You can never prove that a (non-trivial) program is bug free
  - It's the [halting problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem): prove that a program halts (successfully) on a given input
  - Alan Turing proved that this was *undecidable* (meaning an algorithm cannot be constructed that could decide this)
- It's very easy to prove that a bug exists, though...
- But you can give yourself -- and your customer -- some sense of confidence that it will likely work correctly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Bug rate
- A 1990 review estimated that there were 1 to 3 bugs per 100 executable statements
  - Actually, programmers make many more (1.5 bugs per executable statement!), but they will catch 99% of those
- Your job is to catch the other 1%
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Costs of transition
- A much older study indicated that transition and maintenance takes 67% of the cost of a project
  - And that doesn't include an additional 15% of testing during development!
  - Granted, that was during the waterfall methodology craze...
- You are finished with this class when the semester ends
  - If you want to help debug it later on, that's great -- but there is no requirement nor expectation for you to do so
- So we need to ensure that it is well tested before the semester concludes
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Things to keep in mind...
- We can *NOT* rely on the customer to complete tests!
- There will be *NO* new code features developed during iterations 12-14
  - Only test cases, bug fixes, minor feature changes requested by the customer, etc.
- Your test plan must be significant, and must go beyond what is described here
  - You can start [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Software_Testing)
  - If you wait until the last minute, then throw something half-baked together, I am going to get very cranky

# Requirements
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why requirements?
- We can't have a discussion about testing without having some set of requirements to test against
- Requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional
- Software attributes are described by the acronym FURPS
  - Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Functional & non-functional requirements
- Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do ("system shall *do* X")
  - Given an input, what is the desired outcome / output?
- Non-functional define how a system is supposed to be ("system shall *be* X")
  - Rather than specific behaviors, it is criteria used to judge a system
- Functional requirements are defined in the system design; non-functional in the system architecture
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Types of requirements
- Requirements are usually described by the FURPS acronym
  - F: Funcionality
  - U: Usability
  - R: Reliability
  - P: Performance
  - S: Stability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Furps: Functionality
- Feature set
- Capabilities
- Generality
- Security
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## fUrps: Usability
- Human factors
- Aesthetics
- Consistency
- Documentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## fuRps: Reliability
- Frequency/severity of failure
- Recoverability
- Predictability
- Accuracy
- Mean time to failure
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## furPs: Performance
- Speed
- Efficiency
- Resource consumption
- Throughput
- Response time
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## furpS: Supportability
- Testability
- Extensibility
- Adaptability
- Maintainability
- Compatibility
- Configurability
- Serviceability
- Installability
- Localizability
- Portability
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Requirements document
- Creating the test plan assumes that you have an updated requirements document
- If there are no requirements (or the requirements are unknown), then there is no point in testing!
	  </script></section>

# Softawre Defects
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a software "bug"?
- ... when the system crashes
- ... when the system has undesirable results
- ... when the system does not handle border cases
- ... when the system has invalid output
- ... when the system has calculation errors
- ... when the system has control flow errors
- ... when the system has race conditions
- ... when the system has errors interpreting data
- More [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Common_types_of_computer_bugs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a software "defect"?
- Certainly any software bug
- When the software system does not conform to the requirement specification
  - This assumes that the specification exists and is correct!
- Usability problems: too difficult to navigate, etc.
- Missing commands
  - If it's not in the specification, then it's a specification error as well
- Performance issues
- Licensing issues!
  - This is particularly relevant to us

	  <section id="terminology" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Terminology
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology
- Black box testing: internal design is not considered, only external design
- White box testing: testing is based on detailed knowledge of how the code works
- Regression testing: testing the entire system after a modification has been made
- Acceptance testing: running the tests to make sure the system is in an 'acceptable' state (i.e., has passed all the tests)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Alpha versus beta testing
- Alpha testing: done at the end of development to make sure the system works
  - This is what you will be doing during development but BEFORE the end of iteration 11 (i.e., March 24)
- Beta testing: an initial version is deployed, and tested "in-place" by the team, the customer, and possibly others
  - This is what will happen in iterations 12-14
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	<section>

	  <section id="specific" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Specific Test Types
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "On the fly" testing
- Try to do a bunch of things, and see if it doesn't work right
  - This is the typical testing done on may types of projects (undergraduate course projects, short pieces of software, etc.)
- Good as an initial start, but this does not provide very good coverage...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System or requirements testing
- Does the system handle the specified requirements?
- Go through each user case / user story, and see if all the parts are included as system functionality
  - If not, then either the system has to be modified or the use case / user story needs to be updated
- Treat the system as a black box
- Once the user manual is written, you will need to ensure that it conforms to the usage of the system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unit testing
- A set of tests of each individual "unit"
  - Method, procedure, class, etc.
- We have a tutorial on PHPUnit testing, which is a good place to start
  - Both CakePHP and Rails have a lot of support for unit testing
- The unit testing will need to cover ALL the aspects of the system
- There will be a significant amount of code for this!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installation testing, part 1
- One of the documentation artifacts that you must produce is an installation document
- Once done, you need to ensure that it works
- Given a standard Linux machine...
  - The CS 2150 image, which does NOT have apache installed
- ... does the installation document properly describe now to configure and install the system?
  - You can assume a package manager such as apt-get
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Installation testing, part 2
- Don't forget things such as:
  - Enabling URL rewriting for CakePHP
  - Installing all the Rails gems
  - Permissioning directories
  - Database installation and setup
- Note, from the [Deliverables slide set](02-deliverables.html) that the amount of detail you put in about the packages to install should be limited
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Usability testing
- Most of these systems are intended to be used by specific, trained, individuals
  - But not all!
- So while we don't need a perfect UI, it should still be relatively easy to use
- Can the user understand the application flow?  Are the editing functions easy to use?  Is there sufficient help documentation available (likely in the user manual)?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Security testing
- Much of the information in these sites is protected under federal law!
- Can the system be hacked?  Penetrated?  Which pages can be accessed without credentials?
- How does the system handle authorization versus authentication?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malformed input testing
- How well does the system handle malformed input?
  - For *each* type of input, what happens if the input is invalid?
- Likewise, how well does the system handle incorrect URLs?
  - CakePHP can set the various 'debug' option in core.php to control how this is handled
  - Rails can do something similar
  - But you may need to add a 404 page as well
- This may be included in the unit testing (for malformed input) or system testing (for malformed URLs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing we likely won't be doing...
- Compatibility testing: our system is only going to run on one type of configuration
- Load, stress, and performance testing: one or two groups may need this, but most won't
- Recovery testing: our system is not the type that can "crash" very often
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What about other test types?
- If your system requires other types of tests, then you should definitely include them!
	  </script></section>

# Test Plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Acceptance testing
- This is a test (or multiple tests) performed to ensure that the system meets customer specifications
- For our purposes, the 'acceptance test' will be the successful execution of the test plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration deliverables
- All of these are due on the last day (a Monday) of each iteration
- Iteration 7: deployment plan (due Jan 27)
- Iteration 8: master test plan (due Feb 10)
- Iteration 9: continuous integration test plan (due Feb 24)
- Iteration 10: specific test plan(s) (due Mar 10)
- Iteration 11: the full transition plan, encompassing all of the above, all edited into one document (due Mar 24)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Test plan standard
- pIEEE 829 (2008): Standard for Software and System Test Documentation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4578383)
  - Free if viewed from UVa; it's also in Collab under misc/ as well
  - And on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_829)
- We will be following *SOME THINGS* of this standard
  - The full standard is way too bloated and just encourages fluff
  - This is intended to give you a structure, not to restrict what you do...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## I don't want fluff!
- If you add verbiage for the sake of adding verbiage, I'll just get really cranky
  - It's a waste of everybody's time
  - If a section doesn't apply just put a single sentence that this doesn't apply (and perhaps why not)
- That being said, I want a well thought-out master test plan
  - So you are going to have to actually read through some of that standard, various Wikipedia pages, etc.
  - You can start at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Software_Testing)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Test plan contents: the tests
- A list (and brief description) of the specific test types that you plan on performing
  - What requirement each test (or test type) is validating
  - How you plan on doing those tests.  Some examples:
    - Requirements testing may mean that you go through each of the requirements (which must be linked!) to ensure that they match
    - Security testing will require a specific set of "hacks" against the system, such as X, Y, and Z
    - Unit tests: what parts of the system are you testing?  With which unit tests?  How will you determine which unit tests to write?
- The point of this part is to think of the testing plan from the point of view of the tests that are going to be performed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Test plan contents: the stuff to be tested
- A list (and brief description) of the specific things that you are trying to test, and which test(s) will be testing those
  - Examples: requirements, security, installation, etc.
- The "which test(s) will be testing those" part can just be a cross-reference into the material from the previous slide
- The point of this part is to think of the testing plan from the point of view of what needs to be tested
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What should NOT be in the test plan (yet)
- The specific unit tests that you are going to be performing
  - You should give overall ideas, but the specific unit tests will be detailed later
- Full details about specific tests
  - Example: the "installation test" can be a short paragraph stating that the tester(s) will follow the installation manual from an unconfigured machine
    - Since there is no installation manual yet, there is no need to go into more detail at this point
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration deliverables format
- I don't really care what format you keep it in
- Keeping it as a wiki page in Redmine is fine (and the preferable way)
- You can also do this as a Google doc, a Word doc, etc.
- If it is an online document (wiki page, Google doc, etc.), you will have to e-mail me when it is done
  - And ensure that I have access (if it's not in Redmine)
  - If it's not Redmine, then the Redmine wiki should have a link to it
- If it's a offline document (Word, OpenOffice, etc.), then you will have to upload it to Remdine
  - And again e-mail me when it's there
- Eventually it will need to be exported to a PDF
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## End-of-semester testing requirements
- There will be some (relatively minor) end-of-semester testing requirements so that each system's tests operate the same way
- Examples: a test plan document in a common .pdf file name; 'make test' to kick off the tests; following the CakePHP procedure for unit tests, etc.
  - Details about this to be decided later...
- These aren't meant to be onerous, but to ensure that all the systems have some level of consistency
