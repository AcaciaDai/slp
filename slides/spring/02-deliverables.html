# Introduction
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-documentation deliverables
- A working, installed, and deployed system built to the customer's requirements
  - Obviously...
- Source code in some electronic format
  - Posted online, an emailed .zip file, etc.
  - Details about that are to be determined later
- The rest of the deliverables are documentation...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation artifacts to be produced
- Transition plan
  - Including: deployment plan, master test plan, continuous integratino test plan, specific test plans, etc.
- User manual
- Installation instructions
- Programming reference
- Updated requirements document
- STS technical report
- Final presentation presentation
  - Including a one-slide version
- Tutorial (individual)
  - Instead of a final exam
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Size notes
- These don't have to be long-winded documents!
  - For example, the installation instructions can be a single page in the user manual
    - But will probably be more for Rails...
- I don't want you to add fluff
  - Having to read that just makes me cranky and wastes my time
- But it needs to be well English
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lecture notes
- This slide set is (intentionally) very verbose because I want it to also serve as a reference throughout the rest of the semester when writing these artifacts
- So please excuse the fact that there is way too much text on the slides...
	  </script></section>

# Transition Plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- To be developed by the end of iteration 11 (March 24th), this will contain the necessary information for a proper transition
- Audience: the development group
- The requirements document is not technically part of the transition plan, but the updated version is also due March 24th
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections
- Requirements document
  - Technically not part of the transition plan...
- The full transition plan consists of:
  1. Deployment plan
  2. Master test plan
  3. Continuous integration test plan
  4. Specific test plans
- The parts above are due at the end of iterations 7-10, respectively
  - The full transition plan is due at the end of iteration 11
- Initially, each of the four parts will be kept as a separate wiki page in Redmine
  - It needs to be clearly labeled so that I can find it!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment plan
- Due at the end of iteration 7 (January 27th)
- It should contain:
  - Where the system is being deployed
  - What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
    - Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?
  - Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
    - This can be an e-mail separate from the deployment plan
    - And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Master test plan
- Due at the end of iteration 8 (February 10th)
- See the forthcoming testing slide set for details
- This is a high-level overview of the testing
  - From the point of view of the tests: which requirements are being tested?
  - From the point of view of the requirements: what tests are validating that those requirements work?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Continuous integration test plan
- Due at the end of iteration 9 (February 24th)
- We will be using [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) ([on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_%28software%29)) as our continuous integration tool
  - Jenkins is installed on pegasus
- There are three things you will need to do:
  1. Configure Jenkins for your system
  2. Write some tests (but not all at this point)
  3. Write a high-level overivew of your plan for continuous integration (more on this later)
- I will be going over Jenkins (either in lecture or as a tutorial) later
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 1
- Due at the end of iteration 10 (March 10th)
- You need to start planning what specific tests you are going to perform
- The overview of those tests is in the master test plan
- So now fill in the details:
  - What unit tests are you going to use?  What is your plan for determining which ones to write?  How are yhou going to write them?
  - Describe the installation test in more detail
  - Describe the requirements tests that will be performed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 2
- Whereas the master test plan is a high level overview
- The specific test plans add in the low level details
- Combined, the two should describe exactly how you are going to test the system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Full transition plan
- Due at the end of iteration 11 (March 24th)
- This entails taking the four previous sections, combining them together into a single document, and making edits and updates
- It will thus contain:
  - The roadmap for how to rapidly deploy the system
  - A plan for the testing of the system
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section id="usermanual" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# User Manual
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This includes directions for how to use the system
- Audience:
  - A new customer -- say, if your customer leaves, and a new one takes over -- to learn how to use the system when they have NO prior knowledge
  - The existing customer, to use as a reference
  - Assume that the audience has NO technical knowledge
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, part 1
- For each feature of the system, instructions for how to use it
  - If it's obvious, you can just explain it briefly
  - If it's not obvious, then longer explanations and/or screen shots are appropriate
- Nobody wants to read fluff
  - If your user manual is 2 pages and covers everything, that's fine
    - Although I would be surprised if any were that short...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, part 2
- Anything complicated will need sufficient explanation
- This includes explanations as to how the algorithms work (if knowing such affects the user)
  - In particular, the scheduling algorithms
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format
- Letter page size
- Single spaced
- Reasonable margins
- Reasonable fonts
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections
- This is just an example:
  - Introduction
  - Overview
  - Description of each main "part" of the system
  - Miscellaneous
  - Conclusions (if necessary)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## And remember...
- Each of your user stories (or use cases) should be somehow covered in the manual
- So look over that requirements document!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Links for writing the user manual
- [Tips for writing user manuals](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/usermanuals.html)
- [How to Write User Manuals](http://www.wikihow.com/Write-User-Manuals)
- [How To Write a User's Manual](http://www.ehow.com/how_5140680_write-user-manual.html)
- Or just Google for "how to write a user manual"
  - Those are the first three results from that search
- We also have a Collab tutorial on [How to Write a Good User Manual](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/tool/38ee7d60-9626-4b2a-8732-0bc53f30d69c?pageName=%2Fsite%2F34417471-f045-46f1-a50f-738fa387fa54%2Fhow+to+write+a+good+user+manual&action=printview&panel=Main&breadcrumb=0&realm=%2Fsite%2F34417471-f045-46f1-a50f-738fa387fa54)

	  <section id="installation" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Installation<br>Instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This should contain instructions for how to install the system
- Audience is the customer
  - So do not assume that they have any technical knowledge beyond what you already know they have
- If the installation is easy, it can be a single page
 - Some groups will have much longer installation instructions (Rails, in particular)
- This should be included in the user manual
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Assumptions
- You can assume:
  - They already have a system that runs Apache and MySQL (or they know how to install it)
    - But you should include a quick line as to what packages would have to be installed if they choose to install it themselves
    - Feel free to include the instructions from the wiki on how to configure Apache
    - You can copy this all verbatim from the "VirtualBox image configured with LAMP" wiki page
  - phpMyAdmin is installed (or they can install it)
  - That they are installing the software system (not the LAMP stack) from scratch (i.e., creating the database, etc.)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include
- How to create the account(s) that will host the file
  - In Dreamhost or Bluehost, for example, a walk-through of the web pages to configure this
- How to upload all the files from the system
  - Have them download a free version of SecureCRT or similar
- How to configure those files
  - They will need to update database.php or database.yml with the MySQL username, password, and DB
  - They will need to 'chmod 777 app/tmp' for CakePHP, for exmaple
- How to initialize the database
  - There should be a schema.sql (or similar) that they can upload to create the tables
- How to load any default values into the database
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing
- This will need to be tested!
  - The 'installation testing' aspect of the master test plan
- Given a BLANK VirtualBox image, or a BLANK Dreamhost or Bluehost account, do the instructions work?
  - Note that a blank image is NOT the one I provided to you earlier in the semester (as that was already configured)
  - I'll provide a blank image (the CS 2150 one) shortly
	  </script></section>

# Programming<br>Reference
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This is a document intended to allow a programmer to modify the system
- Audience: a person who is (somewhat) knowledgeable in CakePHP or Rails, as appropriate
- The nonprofits may hire somebody to augment the system
  - Or I may have to go in and fix something
  - Or another team may take it over in the future
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Assumptions
- The intended audience knows a bit about CakePHP or Rails, as appropriate
  - Enough to write a simple system
  - But not necessarily a lot of in-depth knowledge
- That the audience has sufficient other technical knowledge
  - MySQL, etc.
- They will read the schema.sql file along with these instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include
- An overview of what goes where, design decisions made, how data is stored, etc.
- The purpose is so that a person familiar with CakePHP or Rails can rapidly get up to speed with modifying the system without having to read through a lot of source code
- Did you use other components (CakePHP plugins or Rails gems)?
  - If so, discuss those as well
- You are welcome to include UML if it will help explain things, but it is by no means required
  - See last semester's documentation lecture (in Resources/slides/)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Consequences
- This means that your code will need to have some comments!
  - In the non-obvious sections
- We aren't talking about full-fledged doxygen comments
- Just enough so that the programmer can figure out what is going on
	  </script></section>

	</section>


	<section>

	  <section id="reqsdoc" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Requirements<br>Document
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- Your requirements document must be fully updated
  - You are welcome to describe features that were not in the system (i.e., the "optional requirements"), but these must be in a clearly labeled section that indicates that they are not implemented
- Start with what was provided to you in September, and edit from there
- All the user stories (or use cases) of the system need to be in here
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fully Updated!
- At the end of the semester, I will evaluate your system on two metrics relative to the requirements document:
  1. Is everything in the requiremtns docuemnt in the system?  And is everything in the system in the requirements document?
  2. Is the updated document appropriate?
     - Meaning if you change it to say only that the system will print "Hello World", and then implement that system, then that's not an appropriate requirements document
     - This means that we need to chat about major edits to the requirements document
- There are other metrics that the system is going to be graded on, by the way
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section id="stsreport" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# STS Technical Report
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- A group article that describes what you did this year
- Audience: a fellow computer scientist
  - Imagine if it were going to a computer science conference
- ALL the members of the group will contribute to the report, even if you are not using this for your STS thesis
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format

<table class="default"><tr>
<td class="top"><ul><li>Two-column</li><li>Single spaced</li><li>Size 10 font</li><li>Standard margins</li><li>5-6 pages</li><li>That will be some-where from 4,000 to 5,000 words</li></td>
<td><img src="../images/slp-article-first-page.png" alt="SLP paper first page"></td>
</tr></table>

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format, take 2
- Templates available from [here](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) (use the "tighter alternate style")
- Available in Word or LaTeX; your choice
- You are welcome to use a group editing system to develop it; just the final version must be in that format
- References must also be in that format
  - LaTeX makes references VERY easy; Word is a pain
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, part 1
- *Abstract*: a one paragraph summary of the entire article
  - This is the one paragraph that everybody will read (and many will not read beyond it), so make it good!
  - The abstract should give a compelling reason why your system is worthwhile.
- *Introduction*: Describe the nonprofit, the work they do, and the problem they face.  
  - How do they currently solve that problem (if they do solve it currently)?  
  - How long does it take?
  - What problems does the current way of solving it cause?
  - We are setting the stage for how and why your system will be beneficial
  - Likely a paragraph about the SLP course structure, STS project, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, part 2
- *Background*: What do they need to know to understand the system?  
  - Likely information about the domain that it's in, as well as the technologies used (CakePHP or Rails, in particular)
  - Recall that the audience are computer scientists!  So you don't need to give more than a single sentence describing CakePHP or Rails
  - If all you are saying is that CakePHP or Rails was used, you can stick that into the introduction
- *Related work*: what other systems exist that do similar things? Are they custom written, or generic? Why don't they fit the bill?
  - This gives a context of what else is out there, so that one can understand where your system fits into everything
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, part 3
- *System design*: how was the system designed?
  - This should focus on two primary aspects: 
  - Overall system architecture (no low-level details!)
  - Followed by interesting/challenging/etc. design decisions
  - This will likely be the largest section, likely also with sub-sections
- *Procedure* (if appropriate)
  - How does the customer use the system?  How do other stakeholders use the system?
- *Results*
  - The system solved some problem – what are the results of that?
  - Example: "The scheduler allowed the customer to prepare a schedule in 30 minutes, where it took 3 hours before"
  - This will require **ACTUAL** numbers (ideally measured)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, part 4
- *Conclusions*
  - Summarize your article and your work
  - "We designed a system to meet the need of nonprofit X"
  - Summarize (and repeat) the relevant results that make the system look good
- *Future work*
  - If you had a full-time job for an entire year to work on this system -- and only this system -- what features would you add?
- *Acknowledgements*
  - Likely the customer you worked with.
  - Not me!
- *References*
  - They need to look like the references in the LaTeX template, although you can also do that in Word
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other stuff to include
- Feel free to add (or remove) sections -- what is listed here are just suggestions
  - Indeed, some of the sections are not appropriate for all groups
- Longer sections should include sub-sections
- Screen shots, images, etc., are fine -- but this is not a picture book, so use these sparingly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Writing notes
- You should not be using individuals' names in the article
  - Other than the author list and possibly the acknowledgements
- You may certainly refer to the nonprofit by name, of course
- It should always be written in the plural first tense
  - "We did this", not "I did this"
  - This is true for single-author articles as well
- Who did what is irrelevant for the purposes of this article; everything was done "by the group"
	  </script></section>

# Final Presentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- There will be a final presentation at the end of the semester
  - During the final exam time slot (Tuesday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon)
- Audience: the rest of the class, the mentors, and the customers
  - And other selected guests and big-wigs
- You will demo the system, the challenges you faced, etc.
- It is to be done by the entire group!  And all group members must participate!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The right attitude...
- Your presentation is meant to show what you have done throughout the semester
- You all will have put a LOT of work in to the system
  - And have a LOT of work left to do...
- The presentation should show off how absolutely amazing the system is
  - People should leave with a feeling of awe and wonder at your software engineering prowess
  - This is a time to show off!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines
- Part of this presentation is a demo of your system (on pegasus is fine)
- Presentations should be about 15 minutes each.
- Everybody in the group should participate in some way; this is a group presentation
- This should be rehearsed, and flow smoothly
  - If you were presenting such a project in front of your boss, you would not want to run into logistical problems during the presentation (such as, "wait, I thought *you* were talking about this part")
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, part 1
- This is meant as a guide, not a fixed requirement
  - And the order is meant as a guide as well
- Introduce all the group members (not everybody in the class knows everybody else)
- Give a quick introduction about what the project is (while everybody else read about them at the beginning of the semester, they may not remember the details of each project)
- Technologies used; possibly including licensing details, if relevant. Here, a "technology" is something that is an integral part of the system.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, part 2
- Tools used (or things used well) - this could be efficient or innovative use of the provided tools (redmine, svn), but is more likely going to be additional tools that you used
  - Here, a "tool" is something that supports the development of the system, but is not part of it.
  - Don't bother explaining to us what Redmine is (or any other tool the rest of the class used)
- Challenges you faced while developing it
- Any significant requirements changes (either by the customer, or a change of the "minimum" or "desired" requirements)
  - Keep in mind the customer may be present, so phrase it accordingly...
- Any interesting testing information?  Perhaps not...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, part 3
- What you feel your system is good at; what it is not good at (or lacks)
- Screenshots: while we do want a demo of the system, you are welcome to describe much of the functionality using screenshots, if you would like
- Comments on things: what worked well, what didn't work well
  - Things not appropriate for a presentation can instead go into the last end-of-year survey or the course evaluations
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="otherdeliverables" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other deliverables with the presentation
- In addition to the slide set for the presentation...
- I will need a single screen shot of the system
  - This is going to be used in advertising and publicity, so make it a good one!
  - It SHOULD include the logo of the nonprofit in some way
- A single slide about your system
  - This is a one-shot description of your system, also to be used in advertising and publicity
  - Make it a good slide!
  - Slides with just text indicate a complete lack of caring about and indifference to... um...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format
- You are welcome to use any software that you want for your main presentation
  - PowerPoint (from Microsoft Office), Impress (from LibreOffice), Keynote (Mac OS X), or reveal.js (what this slide set is in)
  - If you want to use reveal.js, you can grab my slides as samples from the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp), or just clone the [reveal.js repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
- However, the one-slide version MUST be in PowerPoint
  - It's too hard to stich together slides of different formats
	  </script></section>

# Tutorials
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- Just like last semester, everybody will create a tutorial on something
- Audience: your fellow students in the class
- As you think of topics throughout the semester, feel free to e-mail them to me
  - I have to verify all topics
  - And it's first-come first-serve
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines, part 1
- Basically, we want to ensure that you develop a quality tutorial that can be used by future students
- All the tutorials must be developed in the MediaWiki on libra
  - Preference would be for each tutorial to be on one page (i.e. no sub-pages), if possible
- Tutorials should have embedded images, screen shots, code segments, etc., as appropriate. 
  - The How To Develop A Collab Wiki page discusses how to create all these.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines, part 2
- You are welcome to build upon the old tutorials, but you must cite the old tutorial that you built upon
  - And there must be a significant improvement!
- Likewise, you are welcome to build upon existing online tutorials, but you must also cite them as well.
- However, we do NOT want you just duplicating an existing online tutorial
	  </script></section>

## Guidelines, part 3
- We want the tutorials to be quality pieces of work
  - We don't intend for you to have to spend weeks developing it
  - But a quick rush-job is not what we are looking for either
  - Tutorials will be graded
- The instructions for creating the tutorial will be the same as last semestser
  - And I'll get to those as the semester is coming to a close
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Topics
- While many tutorials will be on CakePHP or Rails topics, there will be a lot of new things you will be using this semester
- Some ideas:
  - Using related technologies
  - Incorporating AJAX, jQuery, etc.
  - Testing-related tutorails (Jenkins, etc.)
- But check last semester's tutorials first!

# Submission<br>Requirements
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Consistency requirements
- For the final submission, the documentation files will need to be named something consistent
- Basically, you need to include all the documents that have been created this year
- This should not be particularly onerous (it's really just renaming files and converting them to PDF), and should take all of 5 minutes...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission
- Create a zip called foo.zip, where 'foo' is the short name of your group (VPRSF, vocal, etc.).  It should contain:
  - user-manual.pdf: the PDF version of the user manual
  - user-manual.XXX: the original source of your user manual (.docx, .tex, etc.)
    - If it's an online document, please note this in the readme.txt (see below)
    - If it's LaTeX, you will likely need a directory of supporting images in the .zip file also
  - installation-instructions.pdf: the installation instructions; if it's part of the user manual, please note this in the readme.txt
  - installation-instructions.XXX: the original source; if it's an online document, or if it's part of the user manual, please note this in the readme.txt
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
  - programming-reference.pdf: the programming reference
    - If it's part of the code base (such as doxygen comments), please note this in the readme.txt, along with directions how to create that documentation
  - programming-reference.XXX: the original source; if it's an online document, or if it's part of the code base, please note this in the readme.txt
  - technical-report.pdf: what you turned in for your STS thesis
  - technical-report.XXX: the original source; which will likely be in either .docx or LaTeX
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
  - requirements-document.pdf: what was completed at the end of iteration 11
    - And requirements-document.XXX: the source, or indicate in the readme.txt if it's online
  - Transition plan documents
    - deployment-plan.pdf, continuous-integration-plan.pdf, master-test-plan.pdf, specific-test-plans.pdf: what you developed in iterations 7-10
      - If they are on Redmine, please convert them to PDF (you can just print to a PDF file), but ALSO indicate in the readme.txt that they are from Redmine
     - If they are all in one file, name it transition-plan.pdf
     - Otherwise, please include the source for those files (or indicate in the readme.txt if they are online)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
  - Final presentation materials
    - final-presentation.XXX: Final presentation slide set
    - final-presentation.pdf: a PDF version of your presentation (one slide per page), as I may not have access to the program that you used to create your slide set
    - one-slide.pptx: the 'one slide' marketing version
    - screenshot.png: the screenshot(s)
      - They can be .png, .jpg, etc.  And feel free to include more than one; just number them sequentially
  - Any supporting files (files and images needed to make LaTeX compile, etc.)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
  - readme.txt: this should any explanations about where files (for online files) are or how to access them, or anything else that is relevant to the documentation
    - If there is nothing to report, please just put "nothing to report" in a readme.txt file, so that I know this file wasn't just forgotten
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Code base submission
- The assumption is that the latest SVN or git repository revision contains the entire website that can be deployed on the customer's deployment host
- If there is ANYTHING that needs to be changed upon deployment, that should be indicated in the deployment plan
  - For example: .htaccess files need changing, the database.php or database.yml needs updating, etc.
  - You don't have to include their DB account information; just indicate that it needs updating
- Thus, you don't have to submit the code base to me (I have access to the SVN or git repo); but you will to the customer (see next slide)
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="customer" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hand-off to the customer, part 1
- You should e-mail the customer the following documents
  - Include a one or two sentence explanation of what they are
  - And please CC me on that e-mail
- To email the customer:
  - user-manual.pdf 
    - And the installation-instructions.pdf, if separate from the user manual; if it's a part of the user manual, then no need to indicate this to them
  - requirements-document.pdf
  - A .zip file of the developed website
    - Remove all the .svn and .git directories to reduce the file size
    - And indicate to them that I can also provide this code base as necessary
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hand-off to the customer, part 2
- If the customer wants to see more of the documentation, that's fine -- nothing is really secret from them (I just assumed they would not be interested in the rest)
- And thank them for their participation!  I want to remain on good terms!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Redmine issues
- Upon completion of the project, the ONLY things that should be in the Redmine issues database are bugs that you know are still there and are unresolved
  - Meaning you should clear out all the issues!
  - And if there are still bugs, please let me know so that we can chat about their status...

## I hate fluff
- What a waste!
  - It's a waste of your time to write it
  - It's a waste of my time to read it
  - It's a waste of paper
  - It's a waste of ink toner
- The only thing with a page requirement is the STS article, and with all the detailed sections described herein, you should not have a problem hitting that page length
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Due dates
- Due at the end of iterations 7-11:
