# Introduction
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Non-documentation deliverables
- A working, installed, and deployed system built to the customer's requirements
- Obviously...
- Source code in some electronic format
- CD, posted online, a .zip file, etc.
- Details about that to be determined later
- The rest of the deliverables are documentation...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation artifacts to be produced
- User manual
- Installation instructions
- Programming reference
- Updated requirements document
- Transition plan
- Including: deployment plan, master test plan, specific test plans, etc.
- STS Technical Report
- Final presentation PowerPoint slide set
- Including a one-slide version
- Tutorial (individual)
- Instead of a final exam
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Size notes
- These don't have to be long-winded documents!
- For example, the installation instructions can be a single page in the user manual
- I don't want you to add fluff
- Having to read that just makes me cranky and wastes my time
- But it needs to be well English
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lecture notes
- This slide set is (intentionally) very verbose because I want it to also serve as a reference throughout the rest of the semester when writing these artifacts
- So please excuse the fact that there is way too much text on the slides...
	  </script></section>

# Transition Plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- To be developed by March 25, this will contain the necessary information for a proper transition
- Audience: the development group
- The requirements document is not technically part of the transition plan, but the updated version is also due March 25
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections
- Requirements document
- Technically not part of the transition plan...
- Deployment plan
- Master test plan
- Specific test plan
- Full transition plan
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment plan
- This was due February 11 (at the end of iteration 9)
- And some are still editing it
- It should contain:
- Where the system is being deployed
- What "things" need to be acquired for said deployment
- Servers? Domain names? Hosting accounts?
- Acknowledgement from the customer that s/he will need to acquire those "things"
- And a rough timeline for the acquisition of said "things"
- A single paragraph is fine, if that covers everything
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Master test plan
- This was due February 25 (end of iteration 10)
- See the testing slide set for details
- This is a high-level overview of the testing
- From the point of view of the tests: which requirements are being tested?
- From the point of view of the requirements: what tests are validating that those requirements work?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 1
- This is due March 11 (end of iteration 11)
- You need to start planning what specific tests you are going to perform
- The overview of those tests is in the master test plan
- So now fill in the details:
- What unit tests are you going to use?  What is your plan for determining which ones to write?  How are yhou going to write them?
- Describe the installation test in more detail
- Describe the requirements tests that will be performed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Specific test plans, take 2
- Whereas the master test plan is a high level overview
- The specific test plans add in the low level details
- Combined, the two should describe exactly how you are going to test the system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Full transition plan
- This is due March 25 (end of iteration 12)
- This entails taking the three previous three sections, combining them together into a single document, and making edits and updates
- It will thus contain:
- The roadmap for how to rapidly deploy the system
- A plan for the testing of the system
- I expect that it will be edited throughout the transition phase
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section id="usermanual" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# User Manual
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This includes directions for how to use the system
- Audience:
- A new customer – say, if your customer leaves, and a new one takes over – to learn how to use the system when they have NO prior knowledge
- The existing customer, to use as a reference
- Assume that the audience has NO technical knowledge
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 1
- For each feature of the system, instructions for how to use it
- If it's obvious, you can just explain it briefly
- If it's not obvious, then longer explanations and/or screen shots are appropriate
- Nobody wants to read fluff
- If your user manual is 2 pages and covers everything, that's fine (although I would be surprised if any were that short)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 2
- Anything complicated will need sufficient explanation
- This includes explanations as to how the algorithms work (if knowing such affects the user)
- In particular, the scheduling algorithms
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format
- Letter page size
- Single spaced
- Reasonable margins
- Reasonable fonts
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections
- This is just an example:
- Introduction
- Overview
- Description of each main "part" of the system
- Miscellaneous
- Conclusions (if necessary)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## And remember...
- Each of your user stories (or use cases) should be covered in the manual
- So look over that requirements document!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Links for writing the user manual
- http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/usermanuals.html 
- http://www.wikihow.com/Write-User-Manuals
- http://www.ehow.com/how_5140680_write-user-manual.html
- Or just Google for "how to write a user manual"
- Those are the first three results from that search
	  </script></section>

	</section>


	<section>

	  <section id="installation" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Installation Instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This should contain instructions for how to install the system
- Audience is the customer
- So do not assume that they have any technical knowledge beyond what you already know they have
- If the installation is easy, it can be a single page
- Some groups will have much longer installation instructions
- This should be included in the user manual
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Assumptions
- You can assume:
- They already have a system that runs Apache and MySQL (or they know how to install it)
- But you should include a quick line as to what packages would be installed if they choose that route
- And include the instructions from the wiki on how to configure Apache
- You can copy this all verbatim from the "VirtualBox image configured with LAMP" wiki page
- phpMyAdmin is installed (or they can install it)
- That they are installing the system from scratch (i.e., creating the database, etc.)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include
- How to create the account(s) that will host the file
- In Dreamhost, for example, a walk-through of the web pages to configure this
- How to upload all the files from the system
- Have them download a free version of SecureCRT or similar
- How to configure those files
- They will need to update database.php with the MySQL username, password, and DB
- They will need to ‘chmod 777 app/tmp'
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 2
- How to initialize the database
- There should be a schema.sql (or similar) that they can upload to create the tables
- How to load any default values into the database
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing
- This will need to be tested!
- The ‘installation testing' aspect of the master test plan
- Given a BLANK VirtualBox image, do the instructions work?
- Note that a blank image is NOT the one I provided to you earlier in the semester (as that was already configured)
- I'll provide a blank image (the CS 2150 one) shortly
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="profref" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Programming<br>Reference
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- This is a document intended to allow a programmer to modify the system
- Audience: a person who is (somewhat) knowledgeable in CakePHP
- The nonprofits may hire somebody to augment the system
- Or I may have to go in and fix something
- Or another team may take it over in the future
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Assumptions
- The intended audience knows a bit about CakePHP
- Enough to write a simple system
- But not necessarily a lot of in-depth knowledge
- That the audience has sufficient other technical knowledge
- MySQL, etc.
- They will read the schema.sql file along with these instructions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include
- An overview of what goes where, design decisions made, how data is stored, etc.
- The purpose is so that a person familiar with CakePHP can rapidly get up to speed with modifying the system without having to read through a lot of source code
- Did you use other components?
- If so, discuss those as well
- You are welcome to include UML if it will help explain things, but it is by no means required
- See last semester's documentation lecture (in Resources/slides/fall-12)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Consequences
- This means that your code will need to have some comments!
- In the non-obvious sections
- We aren't talking about full-fledged doxygen comments
- Just enough so that the programmer can figure out what is going on
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section id="reqsdoc" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Requirements<br>Document
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- Your requirements document must be fully updated
- You are welcome to include features that were not in the system, but these must be in a clearly labeled section that indicates that they are not implemented
- Start with what was provided to you in September, and edit from there
- All the user stories (or use cases) of the system need to be in here
	  </script></section>

	</section>


	<section>

	  <section id="stsreport" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# STS Technical Report
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- A group article that describes what you did this year
- Audience: a fellow computer scientist
- Imagine if it were going to a computer science conference
- ALL the members of the group will contribute to the report, even if you are not using this for your STS thesis
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format
- Two-column
- Single spaced
- Size 10 font
- Standard margins
5-6 pages
- That will be some-where from 4,000 to 5,000 words
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Format, take 2
- Templates available from http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates (use the "tighter alternate style")
- Available in Word or LaTeX; your choice
- You are welcome to use a group editing system to develop it; just the final version must be in that format
- References must also be in that format
- LaTeX makes references VERY easy; Word is a pain
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, take 1
- Abstract: a one paragraph summary of the entire article
- This is the one paragraph that everybody will read (and many will not read beyond it), so make it good!
- The abstract should give a compelling reason why your system is worthwhile.
- Introduction: Describe the nonprofit, the work they do, and the problem they face.  
- How do they currently solve that problem (if they do solve it currently)?  
- How long does it take?
- What problems does the current way of solving it cause?
- We are setting the stage for how and why your system will be beneficial
- Likely a paragraph about the SLP course structure, STS project, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, take 2
- Background: What do they need to know to understand the system?  
- Likely information about the domain that it's in (ex: information about autism for VIA), as well as the technologies used (CakePHP, in particular)
- Recall that the audience are computer scientists!  So you don't need to give more than a brief description about CakePHP
- If all you are saying is that CakePHP was used, you can stick that into the introduction
- Related work: what other systems exist that do similar things? Are they custom written, or generic? Why don't they fit the bill?
- This gives a context of what else is out there, so that one can understand where your system fits into everything
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, take 3
- System design: how was the system designed?
- This should focus on two primary aspects: 
- Overall system architecture (no low-level details!)
- Followed by interesting/challenging/etc. design decisions
- This will likely be the largest section, likely also with sub-sections
- Procedure (if appropriate)
- How does the customer use the system?  How do other stakeholders use the system?
- Results
- The system solved some problem – what are the results of that?
- Example: "The scheduler allowed the customer to prepare a schedule in 30 minutes, where it took 3 hours before"
- This will require actual numbers (either measured results or best guesses)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sections, take 4
- Conclusions
- Summarize your article and your work
"We designed a system to meet the need of nonprofit X"
- Summarize (and repeat) the relevant results that make the system look good
- Future work
- If you had a full-time job for an entire year to work on this system – and only this system – what features would you add?
- Acknowledgements
- Likely the customer you worked with.
- Not me!
- References
- They need to look like the references in the LaTeX template, although you can also do that in Word
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other stuff to include
- Feel free to add (or remove) sections – what is listed here are just suggestions
- Indeed, some of the sections are not appropriate for all groups
- Longer sections should include sub-sections
- Screen shots, images, etc., are fine – but this is not a picture book, so use these sparingly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Writing notes
- You should not be using individuals' names in the article
- Other than the author list and possibly the acknowledgements
- You may certainly refer to the nonprofit by name, of course
- It should always be written in the plural first tense
"We did this", not "I did this"
- This is true for single-author articles as well
- Who did what is irrelevant for the purposes of this article; everything was done "by the group"
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="finalpres" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Final Presentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- There will be a final presentation at the end of the semester
- Audience: the rest of the class, the mentors, and the customers
- And other selected guests and big-wigs
- This is similar to what we did at the end of last semester
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Presentations
- You will demo the system, the challenges you faced, etc.
- It is to be done by the entire group!
- I am currently leaning towards doing this during the final exam period
- Mon, May 6, from 9-noon in the lecture classroom
- All group members must participate!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The right attitude...
- Your presentation is meant to show what you have done throughout the semester
- You all have put a LOT of work in to the system
- And have a LOT of work left to do...
- The presentation should show off how absolutely amazing the system is
- People should leave with a feeling of wonder at your software engineering prowess
- This is a time to show off!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines
- Part of this presentation should be a demo of your system.
- Presentations should be about 15 minutes each.
- Everybody in the group should participate in some way; this is a group presentation
- This should be rehearsed, and flow smoothly
- If you were presenting such a project in front of your boss, you would not want to run into logistical problems during the presentation (such as, "wait, I thought *you* were talking about this part")
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 1
- This is meant as a guide, not a fixed requirement
- And the order is meant as a guide as well
- Introduce all the group members (not everybody in the class knows everybody else)
- Give a quick introduction about what the project is (while everybody else read about them at the beginning of the semester, they may not remember the details of each project)
- Technologies used; possibly including licensing details, if relevant. Here, a "technology" is something that is an integral part of the system.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 2
- Tools used (or things used well) - this could be efficient or innovative use of the provided tools (redmine, svn), but is more likely going to be additional tools that you used
- Here, a "tool" is something that supports the development of the system, but is not part of it.
- Challenges you faced while developing it
- Any significant requirements changes (either by the customer, or a change of the "minimum" or "desired" requirements)
- Keep in mind the customer may be present, so phrase it accordingly...
- Any interesting testing information?  Perhaps not...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What to include, take 3
- What you feel your system is good at; what it is not good at (or lacks)
- Screenshots - while we do want a demo of the system, you are welcome to describe much of the functionality using screenshots, if you would like
- Comments on things - what worked well, what didn't work well (things not appropriate for a presentation can instead go into the last end-of-phase survey or the course evaluations)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other deliverables with the presentation
- In addition to the slide set for the presentation...
- I will need a single screen shot of the system
- This is going to be used in advertising and publicity, so make it a good one!
- It SHOULD include the logo of the nonprofit in some way
- A single slide about your system
- This is a one-shot description of your system, also to be used in advertising and publicity
- Make it a good slide!
- Slides with just text indicate a complete lack of caring about and indifference to... um...
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="tutorials" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# Tutorials
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Overview
- Just like last semester, everybody will create a tutorial on something
- Audience: your fellow students in the class
- As you think of topics throughout the semester, feel free to e-mail them to me
- I have to verify all topics
- And it's first-come first-serve
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines, take 1
- Basically, we want to ensure that you develop a quality tutorial that can be used by future students
- All the tutorials must be developed in the Collab wiki
- Preference would be for each tutorial to be on one page (i.e. no sub-pages), if possible
- Tutorials should have embedded images, screen shots, code segments, etc., as appropriate. 
- The How To Develop A Collab Wiki page discusses how to create all these.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines, take 2
- You are welcome to build upon the old tutorials, but you must cite the old tutorial that you built upon
- And there must be a significant improvement!
- Likewise, you are welcome to build upon existing online tutorials, but you must also cite them as well.
- However, we do NOT want you just duplicating an existing online tutorial
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Guidelines, take 3
- We want the tutorials to be quality pieces of work
- We don't intend for you to have to spend weeks developing it
- But a quick rush-job is not what we are looking for either
- Tutorials will be graded
- For all images, create a reasonably named directory in /tutorials/ in the resources section (no spaces, short but sweet, etc.)
- The name should be from the tutorial topic, not your userid
- Put any and all necessary files there, such as images, .zip files, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Topics
- Like last semester, most are likely to be CakePHP topics
- Other ideas:
- Using related technologies
- Incorporating AJAX, jQuery, etc.
- How to write a user manual
- But check last semester's tutorials first!
	  </script></section>

# Submission<br>Requirements
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Consistency requirements
- For the final submission, the documentation files will need to be named something consistent
- Basically, you need to include all the documents that have been created this year
- This should not be particularly onerous (it's really just renaming files and converting them to PDF), and should take all of 5 minutes...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission
- Create a zip called foo.zip, where ‘foo' is the short name of your group (CHT, Habitat, etc.).  It should contain:
- user-manual.pdf: the PDF version of the user manual
- user-manual.XXX: the original source of your user manual (.docx, .tex, etc.); if it's an online document, please note this in the readme.txt (see below)
- installation-instructions.pdf: the installation instructions; if it's part of the user manual, please note this in the readme.txt
- installation-instructions.XXX: the original source; if it's an online document, or if it's part of the user manual, please note this in the readme.txt
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
- programming-reference.pdf: the programming reference
- If it's part of the code base (such as doxygen comments), please note this in the readme.txt, along with directions how to create that documentation
- programming-reference.XXX: the original source; if it's an online document, or if it's part of the code base, please note this in the readme.txt
- technical-report.pdf: what you turned in for your STS thesis
- technical-report.XXX: the original source; which will likely be in either .docx or LaTeX
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
- requirements-document.pdf: what was completed at the end of iteration 12
- And requirements-document.XXX: the source, or indicate in the readme.txt if it's online
- Transition plan documents
- deployment-plan.pdf, master-test-plan.pdf, specific-test-plans.pdf: what you developed in iterations 10-12
- If they are on Redmine, please convert them to PDF (you can just print to a PDF file), but ALSO indicate in the readme.txt that they are from Redmine
- If they are all one big file, that's fine – just name it transition-plan.pdf
- Otherwise, please include the source for those files (or indicate in the readme.txt if they are online documents)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Documentation submission, cont'd
- More contents to include:
- Final presentation materials
- final-presentation.pptx: Final presentation slide set
- one-slide.pptx: the ‘one slide' marketing version
- screenshot.png: the screenshots
- They can be .png, .jpg, etc.  And feel free to include more than one; just number them sequentially
- Any supporting files (files and images needed to make LaTeX compile, etc.)
- readme.txt: this should any explanations about where files (for online files) are or how to access them, or anything else that is relevant to the documentation
- If there is nothing to report, please just put "nothing to report" in a readme.txt file, so that I know this file wasn't just forgotten

## Code base submission
- The assumption is that the latest SVN repository revision contains the entire website that can be deployed on the customer's deployment host
- If there is ANYTHING that needs to be changed upon deployment, that should be indicated in the deployment plan
- For example: .htaccess files need changing, the database.php needs updating, etc.
- You don't have to include their DB account information; just let me know that it needs updating
- Thus, you don't have to submit the code base to me (I have access to the SVN repo); but you will to the customer (see next slide)

## Hand-off to the customer
- You should e-mail the customer the following documents
- Include a one or two sentence explanation of what they are
- And please CC me on that e-mail
- To email the customer:
- user-manual.pdf 
- And the installation-instructions.pdf, if separate from the user manual; if it's a part of the user manual, then no need to indicate this to them
- requirements-document.pdf
- A .zip file of the developed website
- Remove all the .svn directories to reduce the file size
- And indicate to them that I can also provide this code base as necessary
- If the customer wants to see more of the documentation, that's fine – nothing is really secret from them (I just assumed they would not be interested in the rest)
- And thank them for their participation!  I want to remain on good terms!

## Redmine issues
- Upon completion of the project, the ONLY things that should be in the Redmine issues database are bugs that you know are still there and are unresolved
- Meaning you should clear out all the issues!
- And if there are still bugs, please let me know so that we can chat about their status...
