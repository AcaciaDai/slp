## Lecture 16: Wednesday, February 19th, 2014
- Iteration 8
  - Evaluations will be out very soon
  - Montanova, your end-of-phase surveys are due by this Friday
- We are half-way through iteration 9
  - Leads, your first weekly report was due yesterday at noon
  - Deliverable for this iteration is the Jenkins continuous integration job (we'll talk about that today)
- Next week starts iteration 10
  - This will be a phase change for the 6-person groups, but not for the 7-person group
  - This will require filling out the end-of-phase surveys!
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- Guest lecture by the mentor for LEAP, likely next week
  - If you are late class that day, I will get VERY crank
- Today we will start (and finish) the [05-ci](05-ci.html) slide set
  - As mentioned on the first day, the lectures will end in a few more weeks, and Wednesdays will become a second group work day
