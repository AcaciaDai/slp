## Course Introduction
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Compressed course introduction
- Pretty much everything is the same as last semester, expect for the few things mentioned herein
  - See last semester's 01-intro.pptx, and course syllabus, for details (both are on [Collab](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal))
	</script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## git Repository
- I'm now using git to keep track of the slides (and other materials) for the course
  - It is in a public github repo: [github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp](http://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp)
- To install git:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
- To use git:
  - Enter the following command only once:
```
git clone https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/slp.git
```
    - This will create a 'slp' directory that contains everything in the repository
    - Note that much of the content will be added throughout the semester
  - To get the latest version, change into that directory via the command line, and enter:
```
git pull
```
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration plan
- There will be 8 two-week iterations this semester (numbered 7-14); iteration 7 starts tomorrow
- The system must be *feature-complete* by the end of iteration 11 (March 24)
  - Missing this deadline will result in <strong class="red">failure for the course</strong>!
  - Note that we now have a [bunch of tutorials](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) about how to implement various things
- That leaves iterations 12-14 for transition: bug fixes, tweaks, testing, deployment, documentation, maintenance, etc.
- Prior to iteration 12, you will have to implement unit testing (or similar)
  - As we approach this stage, we'll discuss it further
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wait? documentation, you say???
- Yes, documentation:
  - Transition plan (consists of: Deployment plan, Test plan(s))
  - User manual
  - Installation instructions
  - Programming reference
  - Updated requirements document
  - STS report
- I'm looking for complete documentation, not necessarily long-winded documentation
- I will provide detailed instructions as to what goes into each
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Making progress
- As there is no additional semester after this one to complete the project, you will be held to your various requirements:
  - The original requirements document
  - Updated versions of this requirements document
  - Issues entered into Redmine
- Not completing these requirements means that you did not complete the project!
- Among other things, this means:
  - You have to make more actual progress!
  - Last semester some groups didn't make 'actual progress' until the end of the semester...
  - And you will need to keep your Redmine issues updated, as this will now directly affect your grade
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reports
- These are submitted through Collab -> SLP Admin
- There are a modification to the reports the lead has to submit this semester
  - Weekly report (just one!): what the 1st weekly report was last semester
  - TPS report: same as last semester
    - This will now incorprate the material from last semester's 2nd weekly report
  - Meeting report: the new report this semester
- Details about what goes into the first two can be found in the 01-intro.pptx slide set from last semester
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## The Meeting Report
- This to be submitted whenever there is a meeting with an external individual (customer or mentor)
- The purpose is to notify me of such a meeting, so I can contact them to see how things are going from their end
- It is due by the <strong class="red">end of the meeting</strong> that the report is for
  - Any team member can submit this report, and it should be done at the very end of the meeting
- Meetings without an external individual should not submit this type of report
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting report contents
- This report should only be **ONE LINE**
  - "Today we met with Jane Doe (mentor) and John Doe (customer) from 1:00-2:00 in Rice 404"
  - That's really all I want; this report is not meant to take any significant amount of time
- It should NOT go into details about what happened in that meeting
  - Those details are already in the wiki in the meeting notes
  - And summaries would presumably go into the weekly or TPS reports
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Report due dates
- Weekly report: due by noon on Tuesday one week into the iteration
- TPS report: due by noon on the Tuesday immediately after the iteration ends
- Meeting report: due by the end of said meeting
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course meetings
- By request, our schedule will be different this semester
  - Mondays: group meeting day
  - Wednesday: lecture or group work day
  - Friday: no class, unless otherwise notified
- As the semester goes on, we will have less lectures are more group work days
  - This is intentional
- I'm going to get cranky if people are always coming in late to Monday and Wednesday's classes...
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## STS 4600
- Most of you are using this course as the STS 4600 technical project
  - You must let me know when the STS 4600 due dates come up, as I have no other way of finding out
- The *entire* group will work on the technical report (not just the STS 4600 students)
  - It will be an article about 6 pages in length; I will make a template available as we approach that date
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- For the 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases this semester:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-9 (3 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 10-11 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 12-14 (3 iterations)
- For the 7 person group, there will be 4 phases this semester:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-8 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 9-10 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 11-12 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 7: iterations 13-14 (2 iterations)
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment Plan
- The deliverable for iteration 7 is the **Deployment Plan**
  - We are going to go over it in detail on Wednesday
  - It will require input from the customer (and possibly the mentor)
- If you are going to have a customer meeting **BEFORE** Wednesday's lecture, you must speak to me in class today, and I'll fill you in on what you need to ask
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Today's agenda: group meeting
- It's the beginning of iteration 7:
  - New leads and secretaries 
  - What issues will be worked on during this iteration?
  - How will you get all of your features completed by the end of iteration 11?
  - Update the Redmine issues and story point counts, as they are not looking like much of a burndown chart...
