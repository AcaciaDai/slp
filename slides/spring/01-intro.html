## Course Introduction
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Compressed course introduction
- Pretty much everything is the same as last semester, expect for the few things mentioned herein
  - See last semester's [course introduction slide set](../fall/01-intro.html), and the [course syllabus](../../uva/syllabus.html) ([md](../../uva/syllabus.md)), for details
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration plan
- There will be 8 two-week iterations this semester (numbered 7-14); iteration 7 starts tomorrow
  - We have new leads and secretaries
- The system must be *feature-complete* by the end of iteration 11 (March 23)
  - Missing this deadline will result in <strong class="red">failure for the course</strong>!
  - Note that we now have a [bunch of tutorials](http://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) about how to implement various things
- That leaves iterations 12-14 for transition: bug fixes, tweaks, testing, deployment, documentation, maintenance, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wait? documentation, you say???
- Yes, documentation:
  - Transition plan (consists of: Deployment plan, Test plan(s))
  - User manual
  - Installation instructions
  - Programming reference
  - Updated requirements document
  - STS technical report
- I'm looking for complete documentation, not necessarily long-winded documentation
- I will provide detailed instructions as to what goes into each
  - It's in the [deliverables](02-deliverables.html) slide set, which will be gone over in lecture
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Making progress
- As there is no additional semester after this one to complete the project, you will be held to your various requirements:
  - The original requirements document
  - Updated versions of this requirements document
  - Issues entered into github
- Not completing these requirements means that you did not complete the project!
- Among other things, this means:
  - You have to make more actual progress!
  - Last semester some groups didn't make 'actual progress' until the end of the semester...
  - And you will need to keep your github issues updated
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course meetings
- The weekly schedule will be the same as last semester:
  - Mondays: group meeting day
  - Wednesday: lecture or group work day
  - Friday: no class, unless otherwise notified
- As the semester goes on, we will have less lectures are more group work days
  - This is intentional
- I'm going to get cranky if people are always coming in late to Monday and Wednesday's classes...
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## STS 4600
- Most of you are using this course as the STS 4600 technical project
  - You must let me know when the STS 4600 due dates come up, as I have no other way of finding out
- The *entire* group will work on the technical report (not just the STS 4600 students)
  - It will be an article about 6 pages in length; I will make a template available as we approach that date
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- For the 6 person groups, there will be 3 phases this semester:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-9 (3 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 10-11 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 12-14 (3 iterations)
- For the 7 person group, there will be 4 phases this semester:
  - Phase 4: iterations 7-8 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 5: iterations 9-10 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 6: iterations 11-12 (2 iterations)
  - Phase 7: iterations 13-14 (2 iterations)
- If there ends up being a 5 person group, we'll chat about that offline
- Full schedule can be found [here](../../uva/schedule.html) ([md](../../uva/schedule.md))
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment Plan
- The deliverable for iteration 7 is the **Deployment Plan**
  - We are going to go over it in detail on Wednesday
  - It will require input from the customer
- If you are going to have a customer meeting **BEFORE** Wednesday's lecture, you must speak to me in class today, and I'll fill you in on what you need to ask
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Status
- Your customer should have played with the system over break
- You should thus have feedback from him or her
  - (you may have to email them to remind them to send you that feedback)
- That, plus existing github issues, should provide you some stuff to do in the current iteration
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings
- You do not have to have your bi-weekly meeting with the customer this iteration, **AS LONG AS** you get email feedback instead
  - Although you are welcome to do so
- The bi-weekly meetings with the graduate TA will start next iteration
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Grades reminder
As mentioned in the [first lecture in the fall](../fall/01-intro.html) (specifically, [here](../fall/01-intro.html#/grades)):

- Not completing time sheets or surveys will penalize your grade
  - Likewise with reports
- ***EVERYBODY*** is expected to contribute to the project
  - This means, among other things, that there should be (real) git commits from everybody (and likely for each iteration)
- We can re-do the spring iteration evaluations, for example if we could not find something, as long as it is brought to our attention within a reasonable time frame (say, 2 weeks from when they are released)
- Attendance is still required (I know the class starts at 9 a.m., and I can't do anything about that)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Today's agenda: group meeting
- It's the beginning of iteration 7:
  - New leads and secretaries 
  - Is your CI build green?
  - Did you get feedback from the customer?
  - What issues will be worked on during this iteration?
  - How will you get all of your features completed by the end of iteration 11?
  - Update the github issues and story point counts, as they are not looking like much of a burndown chart...
	</script></section>
